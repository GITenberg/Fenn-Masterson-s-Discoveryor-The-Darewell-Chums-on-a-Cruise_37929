<h3>AN AUTOMOBILE ACCIDENT</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Hello!&rdquo; exclaimed Fenn Masterson, as he
opened the front door of his home, in response
to a ring, and admitted his chum, Bart Keene.
&ldquo;Glad to see you, Bart. Come on in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you?&rdquo; demanded
Bart, throwing a strap full of books into a corner
of the hall, as if he cared very little for the volumes.
&ldquo;Why weren&rsquo;t you at school to-day,
Stumpy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I was a little hoarse this morning&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you now; a mule?&rdquo; inquired Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;Oh, hang it, you know what I
mean&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure!&rdquo; interrupted Bart. &ldquo;You slept in a
stable last night, and, when you woke up you were
a little horse. I know.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
&ldquo;I had a little cold this morning,&rdquo; went on
Fenn. &ldquo;Mother made me stay home. Thought
I was going into consumption, I guess. I&rsquo;m all
right now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gee, I wish my mother had made me stay
home to-day,&rdquo; proceeded Bart. &ldquo;The algebra
lesson was fierce. We all slumped.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What! You don&rsquo;t mean to say the professor
floored Frank Roscoe?&rdquo; and Fenn looked much
surprised.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and Ned Wilding, too. I tell you,
Stumpy, it was a good thing you slept in that barn
and became a little horse, or you&rsquo;d have gone
down to defeat on that problem about multiplying
sixteen x, y, z&rsquo;s by the square root of the difference
between&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pooh! That&rsquo;s easy,&rdquo; declared Fenn. &ldquo;I
remember it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Easy? Here, let&rsquo;s see you do it!&rdquo; exclaimed
Bart, and he grabbed the bundle of books and
proceeded to take out the algebra.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never mind&mdash;there&rsquo;s no hurry about it. I&rsquo;ll
show you later,&rdquo; spoke Fenn. &ldquo;Besides, I&rsquo;ve got
to take my cough medicine now. Come on up to
my room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cough medicine?&rdquo; repeated Bart, with a reproachful
look at his chum.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
&ldquo;Yes, cough medicine,&rdquo; answered Stumpy, seeing
that his visitor rather doubted him. &ldquo;Mom
made me take it. It&rsquo;s awful nasty stuff, full of
tar and horehound and pine&mdash;ugh! I hate it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Moral, don&rsquo;t try to fool your mother and pretend
you have a sore throat, when you don&rsquo;t want
to go to school for an algebra exam.,&rdquo; said Bart
solemnly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, honest, I did have a sore throat this
morning,&rdquo; declared Fenn. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all better now.
I guess I don&rsquo;t have to take that medicine. But
come on up to my room. I&rsquo;ve just got a fine
collection of minerals.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Minerals?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;m going to collect them now. I sent
for a small case, of various kinds, and I&rsquo;m going
to add to it. There are lots of minerals in
this section of the state.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see, the last thing you were collecting
was Indian arrow heads,&rdquo; said Bart, in musing
tones; &ldquo;before that it was postage stamps, and
before that, postmarks. Then, once, I remember,
it was jackknives, and before that&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, let up!&rdquo; begged Fenn. &ldquo;Are any of
the other fellows coming over?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Before that it was butterflies,&rdquo; went on Bart
relentlessly. &ldquo;I guess your mineral collecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
craze will last about as long as any of the others,
Stumpy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, all the others were too much trouble,&rdquo;
declared Fenn, trying to justify himself. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
no fun to be sticking stamps and postmarks in a
book, and I had to chase all over the country after
butterflies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To say nothing of getting on bad terms with
half the boys in the school for trading them poor
knives for good ones, when you had that craze,&rdquo;
remarked Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I intend to make a fine collection of minerals,&rdquo;
declared Fenn. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not get tired of that.
You see minerals are easy to get. All you have to
do is to pick up stones as you walk along. You
put them in your pockets and, when you get home,
you look in the catalog, see what kind they are, so
as to label &rsquo;em, and put &rsquo;em in one of the little
numbered squares of the cabinet. Why, collecting
minerals is fun. Besides, it&rsquo;s valuable information.
I might discover&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure, of course. Oh, yes&mdash;you might discover
a gold mine or a hole filled with diamonds!&rdquo; interrupted
Bart. &ldquo;Oh, Stumpy, I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;re
a hopeless case.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait until you see my minerals,&rdquo; asserted
the stout youth, as he led the way up to his room.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
&ldquo;When are the other fellows coming over?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Ned&rsquo;ll be along right away. Frank Roscoe
said he had to go on an errand for his father.
They both are anxious to see what sort of a game
you worked so&rsquo;s to stay home to-day. They
might want to try it themselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two chums were soon busy inspecting the
case of stones which Fenn had bought. There
were small samples of ore, spar, crystals and various
queer rocks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a piece of stone I found out near the
river,&rdquo; said Fenn, pointing to a fragment of a
bright red color. &ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s a new kind of
ruby. I&rsquo;m going to show it to a jeweler.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s red glass!&rdquo; declared Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you it is! Look, it&rsquo;s a piece of a bottle.
You can see where it curved for the bottom,&rdquo;
and he pointed it out to Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; admitted the collector,
as he tossed the red object away. &ldquo;Never mind,
I&rsquo;ll get some good specimens yet. Hello, there&rsquo;s
Ned&rsquo;s whistle,&rdquo; and he looked out of the window,
which, as it was late in June, was wide open.
&ldquo;Come on up, Ned!&rdquo; he called, &ldquo;Bart&rsquo;s here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Coming!&rdquo; cried Ned. &ldquo;Lower the drawbridge
and raise the portcullis! Lord Mount<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
Saint Dennis Morency Caldwalder de Nois approaches!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I guess it is &lsquo;De Noise&rsquo; all right,&rdquo; murmured
Bart. &ldquo;Since he&rsquo;s been studying French
history he&rsquo;s been getting off such nonsense as that
every chance he has.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Greeting, fair and noble sirs!&rdquo; cried Ned
Wilding, reaching the door of Fenn&rsquo;s room, for,
like the other chums, he had the run of the house,
&ldquo;greeting, most noble lords of the high justice,
the middle and the low. I give thee greeting!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I give thee that!&rdquo; interrupted Bart, putting
out his foot, and, with a sly motion, upsetting
Ned as he was making a low, exaggerated bow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;First down! Ten yards to gain!&rdquo; he cried
good-naturedly, as he arose, for Ned was a lively,
quick-witted youth, full of fun, and never serious
for more than a minute at a time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope that jarred some of the foolishness out
of you,&rdquo; observed Bart.</p>

<p>Suddenly a head was poked in the open window,
and a voice exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen, allow me to introduce myself. I
am the original and only genuine second-story
burglar!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Frank Roscoe!&rdquo; exclaimed Fenn. &ldquo;How
did you get there?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
&ldquo;Climbed up over the porch,&rdquo; replied the newcomer.
&ldquo;I rang the bell until I was tired, and
nobody answered.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so, I forgot. Mother&rsquo;s out this afternoon
and there&rsquo;s no one down stairs. But why
didn&rsquo;t you do as Ned did, walk in? The door&rsquo;s
not locked. I didn&rsquo;t hear you ring.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I prefer this method of stealing into houses,&rdquo;
replied Frank, a tall dark youth, as he bounded
from the window sill into the room. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s more
romantic. Besides I needed exercise, and it was
easy climbing up the porch pillar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t give us any romance,&rdquo; begged Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; advised Ned, rubbing his thigh
where he had come down rather heavily. &ldquo;The
days of romance are dead.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the only thing that&rsquo;s dead in this
town,&rdquo; put in Fenn. &ldquo;Things are getting rather
dull. We need some excitement to keep us
awake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The two newcomers soon learned the reason for
Fenn&rsquo;s absence from school that day. They examined
his cabinet of minerals and made more or
less sarcastic comments about his new fad.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; went on Bart, after a pause. &ldquo;I wish
we could have some fun, as we did when we were
off camping in the woods, last summer.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
&ldquo;And rescued Frank&rsquo;s father from that sanitarium,&rdquo;
put in Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we had a pretty lively time when you
slipped off to New York, and the lodging-house
keeper held you a prisoner, Ned,&rdquo; said Bart.
&ldquo;You had some romance then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not the right kind,&rdquo; declared Ned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d
like some more fun such as we had when the King
of Papricka tried to fool us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure! When we got carried away in the captive
balloon,&rdquo; added Frank. &ldquo;That was a
time!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And do you remember when we fastened the
ladder on the donkey&rsquo;s back, the night we were
going to rescue Frank&rsquo;s father,&rdquo; suggested Fenn?
&ldquo;How he ran away in the woods?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and how it rained,&rdquo; put in Ned. &ldquo;Gee,
that was fierce!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we had a good time,&rdquo; remarked Frank.
&ldquo;Father can never forget how much you boys did
for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t anything!&rdquo; exclaimed Ned. &ldquo;Say,
do you remember when they thought we blew up
the school with dynamite?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do I? I should guess yes,&rdquo; replied Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and how Ned thought he was going to
become a millionaire with that investment which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
made him a fugitive!&rdquo; spoke Bart. &ldquo;Oh, yes,
we had good times then. But we don&rsquo;t seem to
be having them any more. It&rsquo;s nothing but measly
old algebra exams. that no fellow can pass. I
wish&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>But what Bart wished he never told, for, at that
instant there came from the street outside a series
of sharp explosions, that sounded like a Gatling
gun in full operation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; cried Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an automobile!&rdquo; replied Frank, who was
nearest the window. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s running away, too,
from the looks of it. They&rsquo;ve opened the muffler
and are trying to reverse I guess! Something&rsquo;s
wrong! There&rsquo;s going to be an accident!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other boys crowded up back of Frank to
see what was going on. The street in front of
Fenn&rsquo;s house sloped sharply down to a cliff at
the end of the thoroughfare. Across the highway
was a stout fence, designed to prevent any one
from driving over the cliff, which was quite high.
Toward this fence a big touring car, which, as the
boys could see, contained an elderly gentleman and
a young lady, was rushing at furious speed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop! Stop!&rdquo; cried Fenn in desperation,
thinking the man in the car did not know or realize<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
his danger. &ldquo;The street ends at the fence!
You&rsquo;ll go over the cliff!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the auto whizzed past the house the girl in
it gave one glance at Fenn. The youth thought
her the most beautiful person he had ever seen,
though there was a look of terror in her eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He can&rsquo;t stop!&rdquo; shouted Bart. &ldquo;Something&rsquo;s
wrong with the machine!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Indeed this seemed to be true, for the man at
the steering wheel was frantically pulling on various
levers and stamping, with his feet, on some
pedals in front of him.</p>

<p>The young woman in the car half arose in her
seat. The man, holding the wheel with one hand,
held her back with the other. She gave a startled
cry and, a moment later the auto had crashed
through the fence, as though it was made of paper,
and the front wheels disappeared over the edge of
the cliff.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; cried Bart. &ldquo;We must go to
their help!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid they&rsquo;re dead,&rdquo; spoke Frank solemnly,
as he quickly followed his chums from
Fenn&rsquo;s house.</p>

<h3>A MYSTERIOUS CAVE</h3>


<p>Running at top speed the four boys hastened
down the street toward where the automobile accident
had occurred. Several other persons followed
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve gone over the cliff!&rdquo; cried Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, the rear wheels are caught on the edge!&rdquo;
declared Ned. &ldquo;You can just see the back part
of the car!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the man and young lady must be pitched
out! It hangs nearly straight up and down!&rdquo;
said Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder if they could possibly be alive?&rdquo;
asked Fenn, as he hurried along, a little in the rear
of the others, for, because of his stoutness, he was
not a good runner. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never forget how she
looked up to me, as if she wanted me to save her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By this time the chums had reached the broken
fence that had proved so ineffectual a barrier to
the cliff. They leaped over the shattered boards,
accompanied by a number of men and boys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
&ldquo;Gee! They&rsquo;re goners!&rdquo; exclaimed a boy
named Sandy Merton, peering over the edge of the
cliff. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a hundred feet to the bottom!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder what caught the auto?&rdquo; said Bart.
&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t it fall?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A wire caught it,&rdquo; answered Fenn. &ldquo;Look,&rdquo;
and he showed his chums where several heavy
strands of wire, which had been strung on the
fence to further brace it, had become entangled in
the wheels of the auto as they crashed through.
The wire was twisted around some posts and, with
the broken boards from the barrier, had served to
hold the car from going over the cliff. There it
hung, by the rear wheels only, a most precarious
position, for, every moment, it was in danger of
toppling over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But where are the people?&rdquo; asked Frank, as
he peered over the edge of the cliff. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
see them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re all in pieces,&rdquo; declared a gloomy looking
man. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re broken to bits from the fall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; exclaimed Bart. &ldquo;Here, let me
have a look!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lying flat on his face he peered over the edge
of the precipice. Then he uttered a cry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can see them!&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
landed on the ledge, not ten feet down. They&rsquo;re
under some bushes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Get some ropes, quick!&rdquo; cried Fenn.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll haul &rsquo;em up before the auto falls on &rsquo;em!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No danger of that,&rdquo; declared Bart.
&ldquo;They&rsquo;re off to one side. I&rsquo;m afraid they&rsquo;re
badly hurt, though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Somebody go for a doctor!&rdquo; urged Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; volunteered Jim Nelson, who had the
reputation of being the laziest boy in the town of
Darewell. Perhaps he was afraid of being asked
to help haul the auto back from the perilous position.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Telephone for &rsquo;em!&rdquo; called Frank, knowing
Jim&rsquo;s usual slowness, and realizing that the lazy
youth would welcome this method of summoning
the medical men.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell &rsquo;em to come to my house,&rdquo; supplemented
Fenn. &ldquo;We will carry the man and girl there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good idea,&rdquo; commented Frank. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
got more room than any of these houses near here,&rdquo;
for, in the immediate vicinity of the cliff there
were only small cottages, and some of them were
unoccupied.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how are we going to get &rsquo;em up?&rdquo; asked
Fenn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
By this time a large crowd had gathered.
Some had brought ropes, and there were all sorts
of suggestions as to how the rescue should be
effected.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get them; or at least I&rsquo;ll go down and put
a rope around them, so they can be hauled up,&rdquo;
suddenly declared Frank. &ldquo;I know how to reach
that ledge. There&rsquo;s not much danger. Where&rsquo;s
a rope?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Several were soon produced, some neighboring
clothes lines being confiscated. It seemed that all
the crowd needed was some one to give orders. In
a few minutes, with a rope tied around his waist
Frank was being lowered over the cliff. Willing
hands let him down until he was on the ledge.
Then, having fastened the rope about the form of
the unconscious young woman, padding it with his
coat, so the strands would not cut her, he gave the
signal to haul up. There was a cheer as the body
was laid gently down on the grass at the top of the
cliff, and some one called:</p>

<p>&ldquo;She isn&rsquo;t dead! She&rsquo;s breathing!&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was harder work for Frank to adjust the rope
about the man&rsquo;s body, as he was very heavy, but
the lad accomplished it, and the crowd above
hauled the unfortunate automobilist up. Then
Frank was raised from the ledge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
&ldquo;Carry &rsquo;em to my house,&rdquo; cried Fenn. &ldquo;The
doctors will soon be there if Jim hasn&rsquo;t forgotten
to telephone for &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>On stretchers, improvised from pieces of the
fence, the bodies, of which that of the girl alone
seemed to contain life, were carried to Fenn&rsquo;s
house. The crowd followed but, at the door a
constable named Darby, at Fenn&rsquo;s orders, refused
admittance to all save the three chums, and those
who had borne the stretchers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The doctors will need room to work,&rdquo; declared
Fenn, when there were murmurs at what
was his right, to exclude the mob from his home.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad mother&rsquo;s out,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This would
scare her into a fit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The doctors are coming,&rdquo; said Jim, who came
into the house a moment later, after the man and
young woman had been laid on beds where Fenn
directed. &ldquo;I telephoned to all in Darewell, but
only three were home.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That ought to be enough,&rdquo; declared Fenn.
&ldquo;I hope they can save their lives. There doesn&rsquo;t
seem to be any evidences of injuries.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The medical men, under the direction of Dr.
Fanwood, the eldest of the practitioners, made
hasty examinations of the two victims of the accident.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;ll have to operate on the man,&rdquo;
declared Dr. Fanwood. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll need several
things from my office. Who can go for them?&rdquo;
and he looked at Fenn, whom he had doctored
ever since Fenn was a baby, on the few occasions
when that healthy youth needed medicine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go!&rdquo; offered Frank, Bart and Ned at
once.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess we can use all three of you,&rdquo; decided
Dr. Fanwood. &ldquo;Dr. Kyte and Dr. Feldon will
need things from their offices. Now I tell you
what to do, just take our horses and carriages,
which are tied out in front, and drive after the
things. That will be quicker.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then, the three physicians having given the
chums a list of what they needed, proceeded to get
ready for the operation. The girl was in a semiconscious
condition, but a hasty examination
showed that the worst she was suffering from was
shock. She could be left alone for a time.</p>

<p>While the medical men were preparing to attend
to the man, Constable Darby kept guard in
front of the house, before which it seemed as if
half the population of Darewell was gathered.
Jim Nelson was sitting in the front hall, ready to
go on an errand if needed, but, on the whole,
rather hoping that he would not be required to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
run. The hasty telephoning had been quite a
strain on his lazy nature. Fenn, at the suggestion
of Dr. Fanwood, remained in the room where the
young lady was, to be at hand in case she recovered
consciousness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My, things have happened suddenly,&rdquo; thought
Fenn, as he looked at the silent form on the
bed. &ldquo;We were just wishing for something
like our old adventures again. This seems to
promise a good beginning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The four boys, who, because of their intimate
association, and from the fact that they lived in
the town of that name, were known as &ldquo;The
Darewell Chums,&rdquo; had been through some lively
times together, as has been related in the previous
books of this series. In the first volume
called &ldquo;The Heroes of the School,&rdquo; I related how
the four took part in a peculiar mystery, and
solved it to their satisfaction, though, at one time,
when they went up in a balloon, and were captured
by the enemy, it looked rather dubious for them.
The boys were wide-awake lads, full of energy
and resources, and they managed to free themselves
from a difficult situation.</p>

<p>Their home town was on the Still River, which
flowed into Lake Erie, and Darewell was a few
miles from that great body of water, on which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
they often enjoyed themselves rowing or sailing.</p>

<p>In the second volume of the series, &ldquo;Ned Wilding&rsquo;s
Disappearance,&rdquo; there was set down the
story of what happened to Ned when he tried to
do a little financial business on his own account.
He went to New York, and there by some curious
mis-chances, he had to hide, almost as if he had
committed a crime. But, by the aid of his chums,
and a poor lad whom they once befriended, Ned
was rescued.</p>

<p>In the third volume, &ldquo;Frank Roscoe&rsquo;s Secret,&rdquo;
I told of a queer case of persecution. Frank and
his chums went camping and Frank&rsquo;s manner,
which had been not only strange but sometimes unaccountable,
became still more curious and bewildering,
for one of his good nature. His chums did
not know what to make of him, and there was considerable
worry on their part.</p>

<p>But it turned out that Frank was the one who
had to worry, because of the danger to his father,
whom he had always supposed was dead, but who
turned out to be alive, though in captivity. How
the boys discovered Frank&rsquo;s secret, and how they
helped him to rescue his father was related in the
book together with various other happenings during
their encampment in the woods.</p>

<p>And now the Darewell Chums seemed to be in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
for another series of adventures, if Fenn was any
judge. The young woman on the bed tossed and
turned in the fever of a delirium. The lad became
rather frightened, and was going to call one
of the doctors, though he knew they must be very
busy preparing for the operation.</p>

<p>Suddenly the young woman sat up straight in
bed. Her light jacket, which had not been removed,
bore many dirt-stains, where she had fallen
upon the ledge. She struggled to get it off. Fenn
started to help her, thinking one of her arms
might be broken. Suddenly she exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The cave! Oh, the cave! It was hidden but
I can see it now! And the men! See, there are
the men, digging, digging, digging! I must stop
them! They will take all&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She fell back upon the pillows.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What cave? Where is it? Can I help
you?&rdquo; asked Fenn eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The cave! They are in it!&rdquo; exclaimed the
young woman again. &ldquo;The mysterious cave! If
I could only find it! I must find it&mdash;my father&mdash;his
wealth&mdash;search for the cave&mdash;I&mdash;he&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; spoke Fenn, advancing to the side
of the bed. &ldquo;Perhaps I can help you find it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He hardly knew what he was saying, so great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
had been the strain of the accident, and so
strangely did the words of the young lady affect
him.</p>

<p>She opened her eyes, which had been closed
when she was talking. A look of consciousness
came over her face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was I speaking?&rdquo; she asked in different tones
than that she had used before. &ldquo;Did I say anything?
What has happened? Where am I?
Where is my father?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The automobile went over a cliff,&rdquo; explained
Fenn. &ldquo;You were hurt, and so was your father,
but not badly, I hope. He is here. The doctors
are with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must&mdash;Oh, let me go to him,&rdquo; and she
arose from the bed. &ldquo;What did I say just now?&rdquo;
she demanded suddenly. &ldquo;I know I was unconscious,
but I was saying something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was about a cave,&rdquo; replied Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she exclaimed in such a voice that Fenn
was alarmed. &ldquo;I was afraid so! Why did I do
it? Forget it, please! Forget that I ever mentioned
it! I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She seemed about to say something more, but
her face suddenly became pale, and she fell back on
the pillows.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
&ldquo;Doctor!&rdquo; cried Fenn, very much frightened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ah, I&rsquo;m just in time, I see,&rdquo; remarked Dr.
Kyte, coming into the room at that moment. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll
attend to her now, Fenn. She has only fainted.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III"></a>CHAPTER III</h2>

<h3>SAVING THE AUTO</h3>


<p>Fenn&rsquo;s brain was in a whirl. The manner of
the girl, her strange words, her sudden fright when
he had sought to recall to her what she had said,
and her reference to a mysterious cave, all served
to give the lad much to think about. Coming as
it did, on top of the automobile accident, it added
to the excitement of the day. He was glad, when
he got down stairs, to find that his three chums
had returned with the things for which the physicians
had sent them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, were you playing nurse?&rdquo; asked
Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say,&rdquo; declared Fenn earnestly, &ldquo;I certainly
was up against it. I had a delirious patient, who
was talking about caves and strange men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell us,&rdquo; suggested Bart, and Fenn related
what the girl had said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nothing,&rdquo; declared Ned. &ldquo;She was
talking in her sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it was delirium.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s the same thing,&rdquo; retorted Ned.
&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t mean anything. She was all worked
up over the accident. Probably she looked ahead,
saw the fence, and got scared half to death.
Then, when the auto went over the cliff, and she
and her father were spilled out, it might have
looked as if she was falling into a cave. That&rsquo;s
all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it,&rdquo; declared Fenn determinedly.
&ldquo;I think there is something back of her
talk. She was only partly delirious. Besides,
she knew she had been talking about a cave, for
she asked me to forget all about it. There&rsquo;s
something in all this, and don&rsquo;t you forget it.
Some day I&rsquo;ll find out what it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a regular mystery solver, you are,
Stumpy,&rdquo; declared Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fenn! Fenn!&rdquo; exclaimed an excited woman,
coming into the dining room where the boys had
gathered to talk. &ldquo;What has happened? What
is the matter? Are you hurt? Was there an
accident? Why is Constable Darby in front of
the house, keeping the crowd back?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There was an accident, mother,&rdquo; said Fenn,
&ldquo;and a man and a girl who were hurt have been
brought here. I told them to fetch them in. I
thought you wouldn&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
&ldquo;No, of course not. Poor things! I&rsquo;m so
sorry! Are they badly hurt?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid the man is, but the girl seems to
be getting better, except that she fainted awhile
ago,&rdquo; replied Fenn, and he briefly related what had
happened.</p>

<p>Just then Dr. Fanwood came into the room, to
ask Fenn to heat some water, and he remarked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is not so bad as we feared. The young
lady is suffering from nothing but shock and some
bruises. The man, her father, has a bad wound
on the head, but nothing serious. They will both
be all right in a few days. It was a narrow escape.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who are they, Doctor?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Masterson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have not been able to question either of
them,&rdquo; replied the physician, &ldquo;but, from papers
which we found in the man&rsquo;s pocket I take him to
be Robert Hayward, of Bayville, Wisconsin. The
young woman is evidently his daughter, Ruth,
though what they can be doing so far away from
home, in an automobile, I do not know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is he dangerously hurt?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Masterson.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it would be dangerous to move him for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
a few days, as complications might set in. If he
could stay here&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course he can,&rdquo; interrupted Fenn&rsquo;s mother.
&ldquo;He and his daughter, too. We have plenty of
room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am glad to hear you say so,&rdquo; replied the
doctor. &ldquo;They will get well more quickly if they
are kept quiet. Now I must go back to my
patient.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took the hot water Fenn gave him and left
the room. The four chums and Mrs. Masterson
discussed the recent happenings, and the crowd
outside, learning from the constable that there
was no one dead, or likely to die, went off to look
at the auto which still hung over the cliff.</p>

<p>Mrs. Masterson rather ridiculed Fenn&rsquo;s idea
that the girl&rsquo;s talk had a bearing on some mysterious
happenings, and she was of the same opinion
as Ned, that it was merely the raving of delirium.
But Fenn stoutly clung to his own idea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll see,&rdquo; he declared.</p>

<p>The doctors left presently, and Alice Keene,
Bart&rsquo;s sister, who was something of a trained nurse,
was installed to look after Mr. Hayward. Miss
Hayward declared she was not ill enough to be in
bed, and wanted to look after her father, but Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
Masterson insisted that the young woman must
consider herself a patient for several days, and
declared that she would take care of her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on, boys,&rdquo; suggested Fenn, when the excitement
had somewhat calmed down. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
see if we can&rsquo;t save the auto.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid if we disturb it the least bit it will
go over the cliff,&rdquo; said Ned. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hanging on
by its teeth, so to speak.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll try, anyhow,&rdquo; decided Bart. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like
to help haul it back. Maybe we&rsquo;d get a ride in
it, after Mr. Hayward gets well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all you care about it,&rdquo; taunted Frank
with a laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but if we do save it, I guess you wouldn&rsquo;t
refuse a ride in it,&rdquo; retorted Bart. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t often
you get the chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so,&rdquo; agreed Fenn. &ldquo;But come on.
If we wait much longer the crowd will get around
it and, maybe, loosen the wire that holds it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The four chums hurried to the scene of the accident.
They found that the weight of the big car
had stretched the wires so that the machine hung
farther than ever over the edge of the cliff.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be a hard job to save that machine,&rdquo;
declared Ned. &ldquo;How are we going to
do it?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
&ldquo;Let me think a minute,&rdquo; spoke Bart, who was
usually fertile in devising ways and means of doing
things.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What ye goin&rsquo; to do?&rdquo; demanded Constable
Darby who, having found his post as guard at the
house an empty honor, had assumed charge of the
machine. &ldquo;What you boys up to now? You&rsquo;d
better move away from here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going to rescue Mr. Hayward&rsquo;s auto
for him,&rdquo; declared Fenn with more assurance than
he felt. &ldquo;He wants it hauled back,&rdquo; he added,
which was true enough.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wa&rsquo;al, ef he wants it, that&rsquo;s a different
thing,&rdquo; replied the constable, who evidently recognized
that Fenn had some rights in the matter,
since the injured persons had been carried to the
lad&rsquo;s house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;ve got ropes enough,&rdquo; spoke Bart.
&ldquo;The next thing is to get some pulleys and find
something strong enough to stand the strain. I
guess that big oak tree will do. Who knows
where we can get some pulleys?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are some at our house,&rdquo; said Fenn.
&ldquo;The painters left them there when they finished
the job last week. I can get them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good!&rdquo; cried Bart. &ldquo;You get &rsquo;em, and
we&rsquo;ll get the ropes in shape.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
When Fenn returned with the pulleys he found
that his chums had taken several turns of one of
the ropes about a tree, that was to stand the strain
of hauling the auto back on firm ground. The
pulleys were arranged so as to give more power to
the hauling force, and then, the cables having been
cautiously fastened to the back of the auto, Bart
gave the word, and half a score of boys assisted
the chums in heaving on the rope.</p>

<p>There was a long pull, a strong pull, and a
pull altogether, but the auto never budged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Once more!&rdquo; cried Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold on!&rdquo; a voice urged, and the boys, and
others in the crowd saw a telephone lineman approaching.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That wire holds the wheels!&rdquo; he explained,
pointing to where the wire from the fence was entangled
in the spokes. &ldquo;You fellows hold on the
rope and I&rsquo;ll cut it for you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Drawing out a big pair of cutters he crawled
under the rear of the auto, and, lying on his back,
proceeded to sever the wire strands.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Keep the rope taut!&rdquo; urged Bart. &ldquo;When
the wire is cut there&rsquo;ll be a heavy strain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys, and several men who had taken hold
of the hempen cable, braced themselves. There
was a snap, as the cutters went through the wire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
&ldquo;Look out!&rdquo; cried the lineman.</p>

<p>There was a creaking of the ropes. A sudden
strain came on them, so powerful, that those holding
the strands felt the hemp slipping through
their fingers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s going over the cliff!&rdquo; cried Bart.
&ldquo;Hold her, boys! Hold her!&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV"></a>CHAPTER IV</h2>

<h3>PLANNING A CRUISE</h3>


<p>Farther and farther over the cliff slid the
heavy auto. The boys and men, holding the rope,
were pulled slowly along, as is a losing team in a
tug-of-war.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Snub your rope, boys!&rdquo; a voice suddenly
called. &ldquo;Snub her! That&rsquo;s the only way to hold
her back! Take a half hitch around that stump,
and you&rsquo;ll have her! She&rsquo;s got a little too much
way on for you! Snub her! Snub her, I say!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bart gave one glance at the man who had called
these directions. He saw a short, squatty figure,
wearing a dark blue cap, with some gold braid on
it. One glance was enough to show that the man
knew what he was talking about.</p>

<p>Bart let go his grip of the rope. The auto
slipped a little faster then, for there were not so
many hands holding it. But Bart knew what he
was doing. He grabbed the free end of the rope
and, following the directions of the newcomer,
who aided him, he took a couple of turns about a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
big stump. This &ldquo;snubbed&rdquo; or slowed up the
progress of the ponderous car, and a moment later
it came to a stop.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now you&rsquo;ve got her!&rdquo; exclaimed the squatty
man. &ldquo;She&rsquo;ll hold until you can get a couple of
teams to haul her back. You can&rsquo;t do it alone.
Too much steam needed!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where you&rsquo;re right, Captain Wiggs!&rdquo;
remarked Constable Darby. &ldquo;I was jest a goin&rsquo;
t&rsquo; tell th&rsquo; boys that myself, but it&rsquo;s better t&rsquo; have th&rsquo;
advice come from a regular sea-farin&rsquo; person I
s&rsquo;pose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m no sea-faring person,&rdquo; replied the captain.
&ldquo;The Great Lakes are good enough for
me, but those who cruise on them know a thing or
two, even if they&rsquo;re not of the salt water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your advice came just in time, Captain,&rdquo; said
Ned, for the boys knew the commander of the
steamer <i>Modoc</i>, which was one of the Great Lakes
fleet of freight carriers, and occasionally tied up
at Darewell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should say it did,&rdquo; added Frank. &ldquo;My
arms are nearly pulled off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go up the street and see if I can get a
couple of men to bring their teams here and haul
the auto up,&rdquo; volunteered Fenn. &ldquo;I guess Mr.
Hayward will pay them.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
The others thought this suggestion a good one,
and, in a short time Fenn returned with two men,
who each drove two powerful horses.</p>

<p>The animals were hitched to the rope and, after
a little pulling and hauling, under the direction of
Captain Wiggs, who naturally took charge, the
auto was hauled back to the street, not much damaged
from the plunge over the cliff.</p>

<p>The crowd stood around for some time longer,
looking at the touring car until Fenn had the men
haul it to a barn near his house. The boys
would have liked to have run it themselves, but,
as they knew very little about cars, and as they
were not sure of the condition of the machinery of
this one, they decided the slower method of propulsion
would be best.</p>

<p>In the morning there was a great improvement
in the condition of Mr. Hayward and his daughter,
Ruth. In fact Ruth could be up, Dr. Fanwood
said, though she must not exert herself.</p>

<p>That afternoon after school the three chums
wanted Fenn to go for a walk, but he made some
excuse and hurried home. He found Miss Ruth,
who looked prettier than ever he thought, sitting
in the parlor in an easy chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe I thanked you and your friends
for what you did for my father and myself,&rdquo; she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
said, with a smile, as she held out her hand to
Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it isn&rsquo;t necessary&mdash;I mean we didn&rsquo;t do
anything&mdash;&rdquo; and poor Fenn became much confused.
&ldquo;I&mdash;er&mdash;that is we&mdash;saw the auto go
over and we hurried out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, it was awful!&rdquo; exclaimed Ruth, &ldquo;I
thought I was going to be killed! It was terrible!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was a lucky escape,&rdquo; murmured Fenn, sympathetically,
wondering if the girl would make any
reference to the cave she had raved about.</p>

<p>But she did not, and, after asking Fenn to
bring his three chums, that she might thank them
personally, she went back to her room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I dared ask her about that mysterious
cave,&rdquo; thought Fenn. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s something back
of it all, I&rsquo;m sure. She acts as if she was afraid
I&rsquo;d find it out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A few days later Mr. Hayward was able to be
up, and after that his recovery was rapid. He
explained to Fenn, and the boy&rsquo;s parents, that he
was in the timber business, and had some mining
interests. His daughter&rsquo;s health was not of the
best, he added, and, in the hope of improving it,
he had taken her on a long auto trip. They intended
to go to Maine, and camp in the woods,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
and were on their way there when the accident
happened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I can&rsquo;t thank you for all you have
done for me,&rdquo; said Mr. Hayward, looking at
Fenn and his parents. &ldquo;Those other boys, too;
my daughter tells me there were three of your
chums who helped.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we didn&rsquo;t do so much,&rdquo; murmured Fenn.
&ldquo;Anybody would have done the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but you did it,&rdquo; replied Mr. Hayward.
&ldquo;I appreciate it, I can tell you. I wish I could
show you how much. Perhaps I can, some day.
I&rsquo;ll tell you what I wish you&rsquo;d do; come out and
see me. It&rsquo;s not so very far to Bayville, and we
can show you some great sights there, I tell you.
You could make the trip along the Great Lakes,
and they&rsquo;re well worth seeing. My daughter and
I would make you comfortable, I&rsquo;m sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very kind of you to give the boys that invitation,&rdquo;
said Mr. Masterson. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s
too long a trip for them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, nonsense!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Hayward.
&ldquo;They can go by boat all the way. It&rsquo;s a fine
trip.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you would enjoy it,&rdquo; said Ruth, smiling
at Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ll go!&rdquo; exclaimed Stumpy, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
more energy than the occasion seemed to call for.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you would,&rdquo; added Mr. Hayward, and
then he and Mr. Masterson began a discussion of
business matters.</p>

<p>A little later that evening Fenn, going in the
parlor for a book, saw Ruth sitting there in the
darkness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; he asked with ready
sympathy. &ldquo;Are you ill? Shall I call my
mother?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no, I&rsquo;m all right&mdash;I&rsquo;ll be all right in
a little while. Please don&rsquo;t call any one,&rdquo; and the
girl seemed much alarmed. &ldquo;I&mdash;I was just
thinking of&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there anything worrying you?&rdquo; asked Fenn
boldly, as the memory of what she had said in her
delirium came back to him. &ldquo;Can I do anything
to help you? Is it about a cave?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; exclaimed Ruth, in such tones that
Fenn was startled. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t speak of that. Oh,
I don&rsquo;t know why I mentioned it. I was not myself!
Forget it, please. It might cause a dreadful&mdash;Oh,
I can&rsquo;t talk about it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was whispering tensely, and she came close
to Fenn. In the next room Mr. Hayward could
be heard telling Mr. Masterson something about
his large business interests.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let my father hear you,&rdquo; pleaded Ruth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But perhaps I can help you,&rdquo; insisted Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no one can&mdash;at least not now,&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t ask me. I must go now. Good-night,&rdquo;
and she hurried from the room, leaving a
much-puzzled lad behind. He forgot all about
the book he wanted, so wrought up was he over
what Ruth had said. He decided it would not be
proper to question her any further, though he
wanted very much to aid her if he could.</p>

<p>The next morning Mr. Hayward announced
that he felt well enough to proceed. The auto
had been repaired, and the gentleman and his
daughter, bidding their hosts farewell, started off.
They had decided to return home, as Ruth was
so upset over the accident that a camping trip was
out of the question.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now don&rsquo;t forget, I expect you boys out to
visit me,&rdquo; called Mr. Hayward, as the four chums
waved their hands to father and daughter when
the auto puffed off. &ldquo;Come early and stay late!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor girl,&rdquo; murmured Mrs. Masterson, as
she went back into the house. &ldquo;She seems worried
over something, but I don&rsquo;t see what it can be,
for her father is very wealthy, according to his
talk, and she has everything she wants. Maybe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
she misses her mother. She told me she had been
dead only a few years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Fenn knew it was something about the mysterious
cave that was worrying Ruth, and he
wished, more than ever, that he could do something
to aid her.</p>

<p>It was a week after this when, school having
closed for the summer term, the four chums were
gathered at Fenn&rsquo;s house. Frank, Ned and Bart
had arrived at the same time, to find Stumpy absorbed
in the pages of a big geography.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Going to take a post-graduate course?&rdquo; asked
Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, he&rsquo;s looking for Bayville, to see if he
can&rsquo;t catch a glimpse of Ruth,&rdquo; spoke Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was planning a vacation trip,&rdquo; replied Fenn,
with dignity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A vacation trip? Where?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On the Great Lakes,&rdquo; answered Fenn. &ldquo;I
think it would be just the thing. I&rsquo;ve been looking
it up. We could go down the Still River to
Lake Erie, and then to Lake Huron. From there
we could visit the Straits of Mackinaw, and then,
after a trip on Lake Michigan, go through the
Sault St. Mary to Lake Superior. Then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and then we could sail to Bayville and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
you could visit Ruth while we sat on the bank and
caught fish!&rdquo; interrupted Frank. &ldquo;Oh, Stumpy,
it&rsquo;s easy to guess what you are thinking about!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3>CAPTAIN WIGGS&rsquo;S PROPOSAL</h3>


<p>Fenn had to stand considerable &ldquo;jollying&rdquo;
on the part of his chums, but, though he blushed
and was a little annoyed, he took it in good part.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can talk about Ruth all you like,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;but, just the same, if you have any plans to beat
a cruise on the Great Lakes, why&mdash;trot &rsquo;em out,
that&rsquo;s all. We&rsquo;ve got to go somewhere this vacation,
and I don&rsquo;t see any better place, though I&rsquo;ve
looked through the whole geography.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And the only place you could get to was Bayville,&rdquo;
interrupted Ned. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s all right, Stumpy.
I agree with you, that it would be a fine trip.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How could we make it?&rdquo; asked Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Walk, of course,&rdquo; replied Bart, with a grin.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s water all the way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Funny!&rdquo; answered Frank, poking his sarcastic
chum in the ribs. &ldquo;I mean where could we get a
boat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hire one, I s&rsquo;pose,&rdquo; put in Fenn, who had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
been busy marking an imaginary cruise in lead pencil
on the map of the Great Lakes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That would be pretty expensive,&rdquo; said Bart.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not millionaires, though we each have a
little money salted away in the bank.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys discussed the proposed cruise for some
time longer, but there seemed no way of going
on it. To hire a steamer or motorboat for such
a long trip was practically out of the question for
them, and, with much regret they all admitted it
could not be considered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come over to-morrow night,&rdquo; invited Fenn,
when his chums left that evening. &ldquo;Maybe we
can think of something by then.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next afternoon Fenn, who had gone to the
store for his mother, stopped, on his way back,
at the public dock of the Still River, where several
vessels were loading with freight for Lake
Erie ports. There was much hurrying about and
seeming confusion; wagons and trucks backing up
and going ahead, and scores, of men wheeling
boxes and barrels on board lighters and steamers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Port! Port your helm!&rdquo; suddenly called a
voice, almost in Fenn&rsquo;s ear, and he jumped to one
side, to allow a short, stout man, with his arms
full of bundles, to pass him. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
man went on. &ldquo;Nearly run you down, didn&rsquo;t I?
Thought you were a water-logged craft in my
course. Why, hello! If it isn&rsquo;t Fenn Masterson!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Captain Wiggs!&rdquo; exclaimed Fenn, recognizing
the commander of the <i>Modoc</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Looking for a berth?&rdquo; went on the captain,
as he placed his bundles down on the head of a
barrel. &ldquo;I can sign you as cleaner of the after
boiler tubes, if you like,&rdquo; and he looked so grave
that Fenn did not know whether he was joking
or not. It was a habit the captain had, of making
the most absurd remarks in a serious way, so that
even his friends, at times, did not quite know how
to take him. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;I need a
small boy to crawl through the after boiler tubes
twice a day to keep &rsquo;em clean. Would you like
the job?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I don&rsquo;t believe so,&rdquo; replied Fenn, with a
smile, for now he knew Captain Wiggs was joking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right then,&rdquo; said the commander, with an
assumed sigh. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have to do it myself, and
I&rsquo;m getting pretty old and fat for such work.
The tubes are smaller than they used to be. But
I dare say I can manage it. Where you going?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
he asked Fenn suddenly, with a change of manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No place in particular. Home, pretty soon.
Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was going to ask you to come aboard and
have a glass of lemonade,&rdquo; invited the captain.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a hot day and lemonade is the best drink
I know of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll come,&rdquo; decided Fenn, for Captain
Wiggs&rsquo;s lemonade had quite a reputation. Besides
there were always queer little chocolate cakes
in the captain&rsquo;s cabin lockers, for he was very
fond of sweet things, as Fenn knew from experience.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t saved any more sinking automobiles,
lately, have you?&rdquo; asked the commander, when
Fenn was seated in the cabin, sipping a glass of
the delicious beverage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. Mr. Hayward has gone back to Bayville.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bayville? Is that where he lives?&rdquo; asked
Captain Wiggs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it,&rdquo; replied Fenn. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s odd,&rdquo; mused the captain. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going
right near there, this cruise. You see I&rsquo;ve got
a mixed cargo this trip,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve
got to deliver some things at several lake ports,
but the bulk of the stuff goes to Duluth. Now if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
you would only ship with me, as cleaner of the
after boiler tubes, why you could go along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Could I?&rdquo; asked Fenn eagerly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;and could you take any other boiler
tube cleaners, or&mdash;or any other help?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I need a couple of lads to dust the
coal,&rdquo; said the captain, so seriously that Fenn
thought he meant it. &ldquo;You see if coal is dusty
it doesn&rsquo;t burn well,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;We have to
dust off every lump before we can put it in the
boiler. Now a couple of handy lads, who were
quick and smart could&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe you could use three,&rdquo; suggested Fenn,
with a smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure I could,&rdquo; spoke the captain. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
it!&rdquo; he added quickly. &ldquo;You and your three
chums! Why not? You four could come along,
and, if necessary, you could all dust coal. We
use a lot of it. Come on now, here&rsquo;s a proposal
for you,&rdquo; and the captain smiled good naturedly.
&ldquo;You four boys come along and make the trip
to Duluth with me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would it&mdash;would it cost much?&rdquo; asked
Fenn, seeing a chance of carrying out the cruise
he had planned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a cent. I tell you I&rsquo;ll use you boys<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
in more ways than one. Dusting the coal is only
a small matter. There is the smoke stack to be
scrubbed, the dishes to be hand painted and the
windows to be taken out and put in again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean it?&rdquo; asked Fenn. &ldquo;I mean, do
you really want us on this trip, Captain Wiggs?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I do. I sail in three days, to be
gone a month or more. If you boys want to
have a good vacation come along. Get the permission
of your folks and let me know to-night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will!&rdquo; exclaimed Fenn, his brain whirling
with the suddenness of it all. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell the other
boys right away,&rdquo; and, not even pausing to thank
the captain for the lemonade, he hurried up the
companion ladder, out on the deck of the <i>Modoc</i>
and, jumping to the dock, ran up the street as fast
as he could go.</p>



<hr class="cb" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI"></a>CHAPTER VI</h2>

<h3>IN PERIL</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s the stuff from the store, mom!&rdquo; exclaimed
Fenn, as he rushed into the house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked his mother anxiously.
&ldquo;Has there been an accident, Fenn?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Got to find the boys! Captain Wiggs!
<i>Modoc!</i> Going on a cruise! Tell you later!&rdquo;
was what Fenn exclaimed in jerky sentences as
he hurried down the side steps and out of the
yard.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, those boys! They get so excited you
can&rsquo;t do anything with them!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs.
Masterson. &ldquo;I wonder what they&rsquo;re up to now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>If she could have seen her son and his chums,
whom he met on the street, soon after his hurried
exit, she would have been more puzzled than ever.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great news! Great!&rdquo; yelled Fenn, as he
caught sight of Frank, Ned and Bart approaching
him. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going with Captain Wiggs to make
a tour of the Great Lakes! Whoop! Hold me
down, somebody!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
He grabbed Ned and Bart, each by an arm,
and began whirling them around in a good imitation
of an Indian war dance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here! Let up!&rdquo; cried Frank. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s it
all about? Who&rsquo;s killed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nobody, you ninny!&rdquo; shouted Fenn.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;re going on the <i>Modoc</i>!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who says so?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How many of us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are we all going?&rdquo;</p>

<p>All Fenn could do was to nod his head vigorously.
He was all out of breath. As soon as
he could get enough wind to talk, he rapidly explained
what Captain Wiggs had said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Does he mean we&rsquo;re to work our passage?&rdquo;
asked Frank. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know as I care to shovel
coal, if that&rsquo;s what he means.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess he was only joking about that part
of it,&rdquo; answered Fenn. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going, if I have
to scrub the decks. It will be sport.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; chimed in Bart. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
mind working my way for the sake of the trip.
When can we go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go down to the wharf and have a talk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
with him,&rdquo; suggested Ned, and they all agreed
this was a wise idea.</p>

<p>A little later they were in the large cabin of the
<i>Modoc</i>, which, for a freight boat, was well fitted
up.</p>

<p>Captain Wiggs repeated the invitation he had
given to Fenn. The boys would be welcome to
make the trip with him, he said, as long as their
parents consented. They would need an outfit of
clothing, with rough garments for stormy weather,
which might be encountered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And we&rsquo;ll do anything we can to help you
run the boat,&rdquo; added Bart, who felt that some
return ought to be given for the captain&rsquo;s generosity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; replied the commander, in drawling
tones, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t expect too much. But if you
could manage to keep the door mats clean it would
be a great help.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Door mats&mdash;on a ship?&rdquo; questioned
Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; of course,&rdquo; replied the captain, with an
assumption of dignity. &ldquo;You see the salt spray
gets all over the deck, and if it&rsquo;s tramped into
the cabins it makes the floors dirty. My steward
is very particular about clean floors, and I thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
that if you could help keep the mats clean, why
it would make his work easier, and he wouldn&rsquo;t
grumble so much. However, if it&rsquo;s too much
trouble, why of course&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll do it,&rdquo; hastily agreed Fenn, fearing
that the trip might be called off. He did not
quite know how to take the captain&rsquo;s remarks, for
the commander had not the least suspicion of a
smile on his face. After all, thought Fenn, it
might be necessary to clean the door mats, and he
resolved to do his share of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, now that that&rsquo;s settled,&rdquo; went on the
commander, as if a load had been taken from his
mind, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ll go into further details.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He then explained to the boys what they would
need in the way of clothing and baggage, and he
briefly described the trip. The duration of it was
a little uncertain as he could not tell how long
he would have to wait at Duluth, after unloading,
before he could get a cargo to bring back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;ll get you home safe in time to begin
the fall term of school,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and that ought
to answer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It will,&rdquo; declared Ned. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s mighty fine of
you to ask us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I guess you&rsquo;ll be worth your salt,&rdquo; commented
Captain Wiggs. &ldquo;Besides attending to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
the door mats, I may expect you to look after the
scuttle-butt, now and again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fenn wanted to ask what the scuttle-butt was,
but as the steward came in just then, to get some
orders, the boys decided it was time to leave.</p>

<p>They promised to be on hand the day set for
sailing, and then, with their minds full of the
happy prospect ahead of them, they went ashore.</p>

<p>The parents of the lads offered no objection to
their making the cruise in company with Captain
Wiggs, who was well known in Darewell. In
due time valises and trunks were packed and the
four chums, the envy of their less-fortunate school
companions, strolled down to the wharf and
boarded the <i>Modoc</i>.</p>

<p>The steamer was a large one, and had good
accommodations for passengers, though she seldom
carried any. This time, besides the boys,
there was only one man, who was making the
trip for his health. He was Burton Ackerman,
who lived in a small town not far from Darewell.</p>

<p>They found that their staterooms, which were
of good size, adjoined one another. They put
away their belongings, and then went up on deck.
The <i>Modoc</i> had cast off, and was slowly gathering
speed as it dropped down the river toward Lake
Erie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget the scenery, boys!&rdquo; called the
captain, as he passed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; answered Ned, with a laugh.</p>

<p>The boys had often made the trip to Lake Erie,
and there was little of novelty for them in this.
But, when the steamer had gotten well out on
the big body of water, they crowded to the rails,
for they had never been out so far as this before.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s almost as good as an ocean voyage,&rdquo; exclaimed
Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you thinking of, Stumpy?&rdquo; asked
Frank, noticing that his short chum was rather
quiet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; declared Ned. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s wondering
if he&rsquo;ll see Ruth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&mdash;&rdquo; began the badgered one, when
the attention of the boys was taken from tormenting
their chum by several sharp blasts of the
<i>Modoc&rsquo;s</i> whistle. There was an answering screech
and Frank suddenly exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look there, boys!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They all looked. On the port side, bearing
right down on them, and coming at full speed,
was an immense grain barge. It appeared to be
unmanageable, for the whistle was frantically
blowing, and a man in the pilot house was waving
his hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
&ldquo;Toot! Toot! Toot! Toot!&rdquo; screamed the
whistle of the <i>Modoc</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s going to ram us!&rdquo; cried Fenn. &ldquo;We
can&rsquo;t get out of the way in time!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a confused jangling of bells from
the <i>Modoc&rsquo;s</i> engine room, followed by more
whistles, and then the steamer began to swing
around. But still the grain barge came straight
on. A collision seemed inevitable.</p>



<hr class="cb" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3>AN ELEVATOR BLAZE</h3>


<p>From somewhere Captain Wiggs reached the
deck on the jump. He tore past the boys on the
run, and fairly burst into the door of the pilot
house, where the first mate was in charge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;d better get ready to jump!&rdquo; cried Frank.
&ldquo;It looks as if we were going to be cut in two.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Grab life preservers!&rdquo; shouted Ned. &ldquo;Here
are some back here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He turned to lead the way to where, under
an awning, some of the cork jackets were hung
in racks. Before he could reach them a peculiar
shiver seemed to run over the <i>Modoc</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s hit us!&rdquo; yelled Bart. &ldquo;Everybody
jump!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys made a rush for the rail, intending
to trust to their swimming abilities rather than
to chance remaining on the steamer after the
grain barge had hit her.</p>

<p>But their plans were suddenly frustrated for, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
they reached the rail, something that towered away
above their heads loomed up, and the grain vessel
came sliding along side of the <i>Modoc</i>, just as if
the two craft were about to tie up together for
loading purposes.</p>

<p>The grain barge only bumped gently against
the side of the steamer. The shrill whistles ceased.
The jangling bells were silent. By the narrowest
of margins a bad collision had been avoided.</p>

<p>Out of the pilot house came Captain Wiggs,
running along the rail until he came opposite the
pilot house of the grain barge. Then, standing
on a signal flag locker the commander addressing
the man in charge of the vessel which had given
them all such a scare, exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, what in the name of the Sacred Cow are
you trying to do, anyhow? Don&rsquo;t you know how
to steer, you inconsiderate slab-sided specimen of
an isosceles triangle!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure I know how to steer,&rdquo; replied the man,
who was as cool as the captain was excited. &ldquo;I
was steering boats when you was a baby. But I&rsquo;d
like to know how in the name of Billy Hochswatter&rsquo;s
mud-turtle any one can manage a boat
when the steam steering gear breaks just as another
vessel gets in front of me.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
&ldquo;Oh, then that&rsquo;s different,&rdquo; replied Captain
Wiggs, with an understanding of the difficulties of
the situation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I guess it is,&rdquo; retorted the other.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you use the hand gear?&rdquo; asked
the commander of the <i>Modoc</i>.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That got jammed just as they were swinging
my boat around, and all I could do was to signal
for a clear course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I gave it to you, but I almost had to
rip my engines off the bed plates to do it,&rdquo; retorted
Captain Wiggs. &ldquo;I reversed at full speed, and
swung that wheel around until it looked like a
spinning top. Only for that we&rsquo;d be on the bottom
of the lake by now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; agreed the other pilot. &ldquo;You
had your nerve with you. Well, as long as there&rsquo;s
no damage done I s&rsquo;pose you can go ahead. I&rsquo;ll
have to lay-to for repairs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Um,&rdquo; was all Captain Wiggs replied, for he
had not quite gotten over his scare, used as he
was to narrow escapes from danger. Slowly the
<i>Modoc</i> was backed away from the side of the
grain barge, and, when at the proper distance,
she was sent ahead again, the other craft coming
to anchor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
&ldquo;I hope I don&rsquo;t meet him again this voyage,&rdquo;
murmured Captain Wiggs, as he walked up to
where the four chums stood. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s the most unlucky
fellow I know. Something is always happening
to his boats.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who is he?&rdquo; asked Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Captain Streitwetter. He&rsquo;s a German from
Germanville. Did you hear him mention Billy
Hochswatter&rsquo;s mud-turtle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Bart. &ldquo;What did he mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is a story,&rdquo; replied Captain Wiggs
gravely, &ldquo;which can only be told after the dinner
dishes are washed. You&rsquo;d better look after them,&rdquo;
and with that he walked away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There he goes again!&rdquo; exclaimed Frank.
&ldquo;You never know what he is going to say. I
believe he&rsquo;s stringing us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I almost know it,&rdquo; retorted Fenn. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only
a way he has, but the trouble is we don&rsquo;t know
whether or not he wants us to do the things he
says. I wonder if we had better do anything
about the dishes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; said Frank. &ldquo;The cook sees
to that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But maybe the cook is sick,&rdquo; insisted Fenn.
&ldquo;Captain Wiggs might want us to help.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
&ldquo;If I thought so I&rsquo;d offer at once,&rdquo; put in Ned.
&ldquo;I used to do it at home, once in a while, to help
out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go ask him,&rdquo; volunteered Fenn, and he
started to find Captain Wiggs, when he was halted
by seeing the commander step from behind a pile
of boxes. The captain was laughing heartily.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the time I had you guessing; didn&rsquo;t
I?&rdquo; he demanded. &ldquo;Wash the dishes. Ha!
Ha! Ho! Ho! That&rsquo;s pretty good!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys, looking a bit sheepish, soon joined
in the merriment at their expense, and the little
pleasantry served to banish the nervous feeling
that remained after the narrow escape from the
collision.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Billy Hochswatter&rsquo;s mud-turtle!&rdquo; repeated
the captain. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what Captain Streitwetter
always says when he&rsquo;s excited. I don&rsquo;t believe
there ever was such a person as Billy Hochswatter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I either,&rdquo; added Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I must go down to the engine room to see
if we suffered any damage,&rdquo; the commander of
the <i>Modoc</i> went on. &ldquo;You boys amuse yourselves
as well as you can until dinner time. You don&rsquo;t
have to peel the potatoes,&rdquo; he added with a wink.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to get even with him, somehow,&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
suggested Ned, when the captain was out of hearing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; asked Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t thought it out yet, but we must play
some kind of a trick on him. He&rsquo;ll think the
Darewell chums are slow if we believe all he tells
us, and don&rsquo;t come back at him. Try and think
up something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good idea,&rdquo; commented Fenn. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have
the laugh on him, next time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The day passed quickly, for there were many
novel sights for the boys to see. Captain Wiggs
was kept so busy, for there were some repairs
needed to one of the engines, because of the sudden
reversing, that the boys did not see him again
that day. He did not appear at dinner or supper,
and the steward said the commander was taking
his meals in the engine room.</p>

<p>The <i>Modoc</i> was going along at less than her
usual speed, but was making fairly good time.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I s&rsquo;pose we might as well turn in, boys,&rdquo;
suggested Fenn, about nine o&rsquo;clock. &ldquo;I believe
that is the proper term aboard a ship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, messmates,&rdquo; spoke Ned, assuming a theatrical
attitude, &ldquo;we will now seek our downy
hammocks, and court &lsquo;tired nature&rsquo;s sweet restorer,
balmy sleep,&rsquo; to arise in the gladsome morning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
and &lsquo;you must wake and call me early; call
me early, mother dear, for I&rsquo;m to be Queen of
the May, mother; I&rsquo;m to be Queen of the May!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll call you &lsquo;loony,&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;early,&rsquo; if
you get off any more of that nonsense,&rdquo; murmured
Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what,&rdquo; agreed Fenn. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re not
studying English Lit. and French history now,
Ned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, most noble gentlemen,&rdquo; went on
Ned. &ldquo;I shall obey you, right gladly, I ween!&rdquo;
and he made a dive for his stateroom before Bart,
who made a sudden grab could lay hands on him.</p>

<p>The others soon turned in, and, in spite of their
new and strange surroundings and beds, were soon
sound asleep.</p>

<p>It must have been about midnight that Fenn
was awakened by hearing a great tramping on deck.
It was followed by confused shouts, and then came
the jangling of the engine room bells. The <i>Modoc</i>
seemed to increase her speed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder if there&rsquo;s another collision coming?&rdquo;
he said as he sat up. He heard Bart moving in
the next room, and presently Frank&rsquo;s voice was
heard calling:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, fellows, something&rsquo;s wrong.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The noise on deck increased, and it sounded as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
though several men were running to and fro, dragging
ropes about.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going up!&rdquo; decided Fenn, jumping out
of his berth and hastily pulling on his clothes.
From the open doors of his chums&rsquo; rooms he could
see that they, too, were attiring themselves with
little regard for how they looked.</p>

<p>Up on deck they hurried. As they emerged
from the companionway their eyes were met with
a bright glare.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A fire!&rdquo; exclaimed Ned. &ldquo;The boat&rsquo;s
afire!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that! Don&rsquo;t say that, young man,
I beg of you!&rdquo; besought a man, attired in his
trousers and night shirt, as he approached Ned,
who recognized him as Mr. Ackerman, the sick
passenger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; inquired Fenn, who was right
behind Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He said the ship was on fire,&rdquo; repeated Mr.
Ackerman. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stand it. I have heart
disease. Excitement is bad for me. Do, please,
one of you, go and find out how fast it is burning,
and come back and tell me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He sat down at the head of the companionway,
as coolly as though he had asked to be informed
which way the wind was blowing. Evidently he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
knew how to take care of himself, so as not to
aggravate his malady.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The ship isn&rsquo;t on fire!&rdquo; exclaimed Bart, crowding
past Ned and Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But something evidently is burning,&rdquo; insisted
Mr. Ackerman. &ldquo;I can smell smoke, and see the
reflection of the blaze.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was not strange, considering that the <i>Modoc</i>
was in the midst of a cloud of vapor, and
that bright tongues of fire could be seen close to
her bow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a big grain elevator on shore that&rsquo;s burning!&rdquo;
exclaimed Frank. &ldquo;See! There it is!&rdquo;</p>

<p>As he spoke the smoke which enveloped the
steamer was blown aside. The boys could then
note that, during the night the vessel had approached
close to shore. They were near a good-sized
city, and, among the wharfs was a big building,
built to hold grain in readiness to load on the
lake steamers.</p>

<p>From the top of this flames were shooting high
into the air, and the <i>Modoc</i> was approaching it at
full speed.</p>



<hr class="cb" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3>FENN HEARS SOMETHING</h3>


<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? Can&rsquo;t Captain Wiggs
stop the ship?&rdquo; cried Fenn, for it certainly looked
as if the <i>Modoc</i> was going to run, full tilt, into
the flames, which were right at the water&rsquo;s edge,
as the elevator was on the end of the wharf.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Clang!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The half speed bell sounded from the engine
room. The steamer began to slacken speed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Clang! Clang!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Two gongs. Stop the engines. The <i>Modoc</i>
was going ahead under her own momentum only.
Then another signal.</p>

<p>Under the stern of the steamer the water boiled
and bubbled as the great screw was reversed, to
check the vessel&rsquo;s way. The jingling bell, following
the signal to reverse, indicated to the engineer
to back his machinery at full speed, and the big
craft fairly quivered, so great was the strain of
stopping her up short.</p>

<p>But they were master-hands aboard the <i>Modoc</i><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
and she swung broadside to a wharf as gently as
a boy brings his toy boat to a stop. From the
deck men leaped to the string piece, with great
ropes in their hands, which they made fast to butts
and piling. The steamer was tied up, so close to
the burning elevator that the boys could feel the
heat of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do, captain?&rdquo; asked
Mr. Ackerman, who seemed to have recovered
from his nervousness, when he found the <i>Modoc</i>
was in no danger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to help douse that fire!&rdquo; cried the
commander. &ldquo;Lively with that hose, men!
Lively now! Snatch her quick and I&rsquo;ll give you
all the water you can handle!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Several brawny deck-hands began pulling a line
of hose over the side. Other men were lowering
a big boat, into which the men with the hose
jumped. The hose was unreeled after them as
they pulled out on the lake, in front of the burning
elevator.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid it&rsquo;s a goner,&rdquo; remarked Captain
Wiggs, as a gust of wind sent the leaping flames
licking along the surface of the water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did it happen?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whose place is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you going to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
Those were some of the questions which the
boys asked Captain Wiggs. He answered them
all, comprehensively.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s an elevator in which the owners of the
<i>Modoc</i> are interested,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I was to call
there to-morrow for a load of grain. I was heading
for the wharf, intending to tie up until morning,
when I saw flames shooting out of the top
of the shaft. I&rsquo;ve got a powerful pump aboard,
and I knew they didn&rsquo;t have any fire boat in town,
so I speeded the <i>Modoc</i> as close as I could. I
don&rsquo;t believe I can do much, but I&rsquo;m going to try.
I&rsquo;m afraid the fire has too much start.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can we go ashore and watch it?&rdquo; asked Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess so. Don&rsquo;t go too near, and be careful
you don&rsquo;t fall off the pier. It&rsquo;s deep water all
around.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain Wiggs hurried down to the engine
room, for the men with the hose in the boat were
now as close as they dared to go to the fire, and
could use water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on, fellows!&rdquo; cried Ned. &ldquo;We don&rsquo;t
often get a chance to see a big fire like this.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They leaped to the wharf, since no gang plank
had been run out, and were soon hurrying along
the pier to shore. The elevator was several slips
or piers distant, and the boys would have to go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
ashore to reach it. As they ran on they could hear
the big pump of the <i>Modoc</i> beginning to force
water from the lake through the hose, the nozzle
of which the men in the row boat directed at the
fire.</p>

<p>In the street along the water front the four
chums found a great crowd. Every one was hurrying
to the blaze. Men were shouting, boys were
yelling, and even women and girls had hurriedly
dressed to come out to the conflagration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The whole block back of the elevator&rsquo;ll go,
if they don&rsquo;t stop it pretty soon!&rdquo; yelled a man
as he passed on the run.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here comes the water-tower!&rdquo; shouted several.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look out there!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Clear the way!&rdquo;</p>

<p>An insistent clanging of a fire gong to the accompaniment
of barking dogs told that some piece
of apparatus was dashing along the street. The
boys felt some one from behind thrust them to one
side.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look out!&rdquo; a policeman shouted in their ears.
&ldquo;Do you want to be killed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They shrank back, burying themselves in the
crowd on either side of the way, just as the water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
tower, with the plunging horses foam-flecked and
heaving, dashed by.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve sent for more engines from Frenchtown!&rdquo;
cried some one in the throng.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll need all they can get.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The warehouse&rsquo;ll go next!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;d better use dynamite!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This shows we ought to have a fire boat!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This department don&rsquo;t know how to handle a
blaze like that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Remarks of this nature kept floating to the ears
of the boys as they hurried along, arm in arm,
so they would not become separated in the press
that was on every side of them.</p>

<p>Above the din sounded a shrill whistle, and a
fire-engine, spouting sparks, with the stoker at the
back, clinging to the rail with one hand, and with
the other throwing soft coal on the glowing mass
under the boiler, crammed his head out to see
how much farther the panting horses had to run.</p>

<p>The blazing elevator was hidden from sight
of the boys by several buildings that intervened,
but by looking up they could see the lurid sky,
and the smoke-laden air, in which glowed dull red
sparks, like stars. Suddenly the crowd, of which
the four chums formed a part, swung around a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
corner. Then a terrible, but vivid scene was presented.</p>

<p>On the end of a big wharf, with the black lake
as a background, was the flaming structure. It
stood out boldly, like a picture framed in ebony,
illuminating itself by leaping, licking tongues of
yellow fire, that seemed to tumble and toss&mdash;to
twist and coil about like devouring serpents.</p>

<p>Up shot the flames&mdash;far above the slanting,
narrow roof of the elevator. The windows shone
out as though millions of candles had been placed
in them. Through some casements, darting spears
of fire glanced, as if to transfix anything in their
path, not satisfied with what was within. The
piles of grain made a dense smoke, and the peculiar
structure of the building, like some immense chimney,
gave a draught that seemed to doom the elevator
to complete destruction.</p>

<p>At the foot of the building could be seen a dark
mass of firemen, moving here and there. In spots
it was illuminated by little spurts of flame, where
the engines were puffing like mad to send the
quenching water on the fiercely burning timbers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ll never stop that fire!&rdquo; shouted a man
close to the chums. &ldquo;The roof&rsquo;ll cave in soon!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t they use the stand pipes in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
elevator?&rdquo; asked another man. &ldquo;No engine
they&rsquo;ve got can throw water to the roof.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The stand pipes are melted by now,&rdquo; was the
answer. &ldquo;They tried &rsquo;em, but it got too hot.
There she goes!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The flames seemed to make one final leap, as
if to reach a higher point in the air than they had
yet attained. There was a sound as though a great
gun had exploded and the roof, blown off by the
heated air inside, and by the gases generated from
the burning grain, was scattered into a thousand
pieces.</p>

<p>Then, as if satisfied that it had accomplished
what it set out to do, the fire died down a little.
The top stories of the elevator toppled in, and
the mass seemed to crumple up. Owing to the
packed heaps of grain it was burning slowly, now
that most of the wood work was consumed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s another blow to Hayward!&rdquo; spoke a
voice so close to Fenn&rsquo;s ear that the boy started
in spite of himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; cautioned a man, who was beside
the one who had first spoken, &ldquo;some one might
hear you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No one knows what I&rsquo;m talking about,&rdquo; was
the answer. &ldquo;I guess Hayward will be willing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
to talk business now. He can&rsquo;t stand many such
losses as this, even if he does own most of Bayville.
I understand he didn&rsquo;t carry much insurance
on this grain, as it was stored for quick movement.
Now, when I see him&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man stopped suddenly, for Fenn was looking
right at him. Somehow the youth knew instinctively
that he was talking about the Mr. Hayward
who had been injured in the auto accident.
What could it mean? Why was the speaker glad
that the westerner had suffered a loss in the elevator
fire? Fenn wanted to hear more.</p>

<p>But the man who had first spoken, said nothing
further. He grasped his companion by the arm,
and nodded toward Fenn. The other boys were
still watching the fire, and were some distance
away from Stumpy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Were you&mdash;&rdquo; began the first speaker, looking
at Fenn, when his companion suddenly drew him
back among the crowd.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop! Stop!&rdquo; Fenn heard him whisper. &ldquo;I
must get hold of him and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was some mystery here. Fenn vaguely
felt it, but he could not tell what it was. There
was a movement in the throng, and Fenn&rsquo;s chums
were pressed back to where he stood.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
&ldquo;Here comes some more engines!&rdquo; was the
cry.</p>

<p>Additional steamers, summoned from an adjoining
city, rattled up. The fire, which had died
down, seemed to break out afresh, as the flames
seized on new material.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I tell you I&rsquo;m going to find out about him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was the voice of the man who had spoken
of Mr. Hayward. Fenn glanced around. The
fellow, who had a sinister face, was making his
way toward him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe they&rsquo;re thieves or pickpockets,&rdquo;
thought Fenn. &ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;d better get out of
here while we have the chance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He leaned forward and grasped Bart by the
arm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; he hoarsely whispered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What for?&rdquo; inquired Bart. &ldquo;The fire isn&rsquo;t
half over.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on,&rdquo; repeated Fenn earnestly. &ldquo;I
think Captain Wiggs may want us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was so insistent, and nodded in such a peculiar
way that Bart realized something unusual was
in the wind. Pulling Ned and Frank close to
him, Fenn whispered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think some pickpockets are trying to rob<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
us. I&rsquo;ve brought my money with me. Let&rsquo;s get
out of here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys made a quick turn in the crowd, and
worked their way to where the press was not so
thick. Fenn led the way, looking back to see if
the men were following.</p>

<p>They were. The man with the sinister face,
and his companion, were trailing close after the
boys.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; cried Fenn, suddenly breaking
into a run.</p>

<p>But the men were not to be so easily left behind.
They, too, quickened their pace, and pursued
the four chums, though what their motive
was the boys could only guess.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>

<h3>OFF AGAIN</h3>


<p>The boys soon found themselves mixed up in
another part of the crowd, that had, apparently,
come down a side street leading to the lake front.
They had some trouble disengaging themselves
from it, and, when they again had a fairly clear
street to run through, they were some distance
from the fire.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did we lose &rsquo;em?&rdquo; asked Fenn, panting from
the run.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What? Who?&rdquo; asked Frank, who did not
exactly understand the cause for the sudden retreat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those two&mdash;pickpockets,&rdquo; replied Fenn, not
knowing exactly how to classify the strange men.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here comes a couple of fellows on the run,&rdquo;
said Ned. &ldquo;I guess they&rsquo;re still after us. Let&rsquo;s
wait and ask what they want. They haven&rsquo;t any
right to follow us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; urged Fenn. &ldquo;Come on back to
the steamer.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
He seemed so much in earnest that his chums
did not stop to ask questions, but increased their
speed. Just as they reached the wharf, at the
end of which the <i>Modoc</i> was tied, another fire engine,
hastening to the elevator blaze, dashed by.</p>

<p>There was a quick clanging of the gong, and a
shrill screech from the whistle. It was instantly
followed by a shout.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The engine struck one of the men!&rdquo; cried
Frank, looking back. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s knocked down!
Run over I guess! Come on back!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys hesitated. They did not want to
leave an injured man, even if he and his companion
had been pursuing them. The street, at
this point, was deserted, save for the two strangers.
The engine did not stop, the horses being urged
on by the driver, who did not want to have the
reputation of arriving last at the conflagration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on back and help him,&rdquo; urged Bart,
who was always anxious to aid persons in distress,
even if they were enemies.</p>

<p>The others hesitated. It was rather a risk,
Fenn thought. But the problem was solved for
them. The man who had been knocked down by
the engine arose to his feet. Supporting himself
on the shoulder of his companion he limped off up
the street, and away from the boys.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
&ldquo;I guess he isn&rsquo;t badly hurt,&rdquo; remarked Ned.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll not chase us any more. That engine came
along just in time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Except I guess it&rsquo;s too late to help put out
the fire,&rdquo; said Frank. &ldquo;There can&rsquo;t be much left
of the elevator.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what did we run for?&rdquo; asked Ned.
&ldquo;Who were those chaps, Fenn?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fenn explained what he had heard, and expressed
the belief that the men had some business
enmity against Mr. Hayward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They seemed delighted that the elevator, containing
his grain, burned down; or at least the
one man did,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Then, when they saw
I was listening, though I didn&rsquo;t really intend to,
they acted as though they wanted to get hold of
me, and see why I was so interested. I thought
they might be pickpockets, but now I don&rsquo;t believe
they were.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must tell Captain Wiggs about it,&rdquo; suggested
Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe I will,&rdquo; answered Fenn. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t want him to laugh at me, and I think he
surely will if I suggest that the men chased us.
He&rsquo;ll probably think we took two harmless citizens
for burglars. No, I think the best plan will be
to wait and see what turns up.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what you can do,&rdquo; spoke Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; inquired Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can ask Captain Wiggs who owned that
grain in the burned elevator. He&rsquo;ll know, as he
was going to get a load there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good idea,&rdquo; responded Fenn. &ldquo;I will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys were soon aboard the ship again.
They found that the men in the rowboat had returned,
as the side of the elevator nearest the lake
had all burned away, and their hose was no longer
effective. The fire was under control now, but
was still blazing well. Enough engines had arrived
to prevent it spreading.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, this knocks my plans all askew,&rdquo; remarked
the commander of the <i>Modoc</i>, when the
boys came on deck. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know where to get
my grain, now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you say the same company that owned
this steamer owned that grain?&rdquo; asked Fenn, seeing
a good chance to obtain the information he
wanted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I said they owned the elevator,&rdquo; replied
the captain. &ldquo;The grain is a separate matter. I
don&rsquo;t know whose that was. Whoever it belonged
to won&rsquo;t get much good from it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there any way of telling who owned it?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
asked Fenn, for he thought, even though the men
had mentioned the name &ldquo;Hayward,&rdquo; that it might
be some other man than the one injured in the
auto accident&mdash;some one else than the father of
Ruth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, I can tell by looking at my order slips,&rdquo;
replied Mr. Wiggs. &ldquo;Why are you so interested?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was wondering if it was any one I knew,&rdquo;
answered Fenn, a little evasively, as he did not
want to explain what had happened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Um&mdash;let&rsquo;s see,&rdquo; and Captain Wiggs who,
followed by the boys had gone to the main cabin,
began thumbing over the pages of a small book
he took from his pocket. &ldquo;&lsquo;Proceed to&rsquo;&mdash;no,
that&rsquo;s not it&mdash;&lsquo;take cargo&rsquo;&mdash;um&mdash;no, it must
be on the next page&mdash;Oh, yes, here it is. &lsquo;Get
cargo of grain at Lakeville, from Robert Hayward
Company.&rsquo; That&rsquo;s it. The grain belonged to
Robert Hayward&mdash;why&mdash;er&mdash;say, boys, that&rsquo;s
the name of the man who was hurt back there in
Darewell&mdash;he and his daughter Ruth&mdash;you
know him&mdash;why, Fenn, he was at your house!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So he was!&rdquo; exclaimed Fenn, his knowledge
thus unexpectedly confirmed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Quite a remarkable coincidence!&rdquo; went on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
Captain. &ldquo;Very strange! Well, strange things
are always happening. You didn&rsquo;t hear what
started the fire, did you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard a policeman say it was spontaneous
combustion,&rdquo; said Frank, &ldquo;but they always give
that as a cause, when they can&rsquo;t think of any other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t s&rsquo;pose they&rsquo;ll ever find out,&rdquo; remarked
the captain. &ldquo;Well, I can&rsquo;t do anything more.
We&rsquo;d better turn in, although it&rsquo;s most morning.
Soon as it gets daylight I&rsquo;ll have to hustle around
and find out what I&rsquo;m going to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain Wiggs was a very busy man the next
day, sending messages to the steamer&rsquo;s owners to
ascertain their wishes. The boys visited the elevator,
in which great piles of grain were still
smouldering, in spite of the tons of water poured
on them. Fenn kept a lookout for the mysterious
men, but did not see anything of them.</p>

<p>Captain Wiggs had to remain tied up at Lakeville
until he received orders to proceed to the next
port for a cargo that would be awaiting him there.
The boys spent the time on shore, visiting various
scenes of interest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;re off again!&rdquo; cried the commander,
on the morning of the third day, as he came hurrying
down the dock, waving a telegram in his hand.
&ldquo;Tying-up is no fun. You may get under way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
as soon as possible, Mr. Sidleton,&rdquo; he added to
the first mate.</p>

<p>Steam was up, and, in a short time the <i>Modoc</i>
was again plowing the waters of Lake Erie.
Gradually Lakeville was left behind, and soon
they were out of sight of land.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ding-dong! Ding-dong! Ding-dong! Ding-dong!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A bell suddenly sounded, with queer double
strokes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eight bells!&rdquo; exclaimed Captain Wiggs, as
he arose from a deck chair where he had been
sitting, to the boys. &ldquo;Time for mess,&rdquo; and he
led the way toward the dining saloon.</p>

<p>As he was about to descend the companionway
he looked over the rail. Astern of the <i>Modoc</i>
was a small steam yacht, coming on at a swift
speed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s queer,&rdquo; murmured the captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is?&rdquo; asked Fenn, for the boys were
privileged characters.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That yacht,&rdquo; replied the commander. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s
been following us all the morning; ever since we
left Lakeville. I wonder what the game is?
Steward, bring me the glass,&rdquo; he called, and, when
the binoculars were handed to him, the captain
took a long look at the pursuing craft.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>THE CHASE</h3>


<p>For nearly a minute Captain Wiggs continued
his observation of the on-coming boat. Then,
laying aside the glass, he remarked:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make anything out of her. It&rsquo;s a
strange boat. Never saw her on the lakes before.
And they seem to have an uncommon interest in
us. A couple of men on deck are taking turns
in looking at us through a telescope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Two men?&rdquo; asked Fenn, beginning to get
excited.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are two on deck, but of course there
must be more somewhere aboard,&rdquo; replied the
captain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And has one of them a&mdash;a sort of mean
looking face?&rdquo; went on Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, from what I can see of him through
the glass, he doesn&rsquo;t look to be a very cheerful
chap.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wager it&rsquo;s those men after us!&rdquo; exclaimed
Fenn, turning to his chums.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
&ldquo;What men?&rdquo; inquired Captain Wiggs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The men who chased us when we were at
the elevator fire,&rdquo; and Fenn told of the adventure.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish you had mentioned that to me before,&rdquo;
said the commander, looking grave. &ldquo;This thing
may be serious.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why? Do you think they are thieves?&rdquo;
asked Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no telling what they are,&rdquo; and the
captain took another observation at the steamer
in the rear. &ldquo;You know the lakes are part of
the dividing line between the United States and
Canada. Often criminals from both countries find
it to their advantage to conduct some of their
operations on the water, and there are any number
of questionable characters plying on this lake. I
can&rsquo;t make out why those men should want you
boys, or Fenn, more particularly, unless they think
he may know something of their operations, and
they want to stop him from talking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, they can&rsquo;t prevent me!&rdquo; boasted Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be too sure,&rdquo; cautioned the captain.
&ldquo;Of course you have nothing to fear as long as
you are with me, aboard the <i>Modoc</i>, but don&rsquo;t run
any chances while ashore. Meanwhile those fellows
have got to catch us first. They&rsquo;ve got nerve,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
I must say, pursuing us as if they were government
officers and we were smugglers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do smugglers cross the lake?&rdquo; asked Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They try to, and, sometimes they succeed.
But I wish you boys would go down to dinner.
I want to keep watch of this boat. When you
finish, come up on deck, and you can stand guard,
while I eat. We&rsquo;ll keep tabs on her then, and we
needn&rsquo;t let any of the crew here know about it.
It&rsquo;s just as well to keep matters a little quiet until
we find out what it all means.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys did not linger long over their dinner,
and were soon on deck again. They found Captain
Wiggs gazing at the pursuing steam yacht
through the glass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s coming on,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Seems to have
plenty of speed, but I guess we can show her a
little ourselves. I&rsquo;ll give orders to the engineer
to increase our rate some. Then we&rsquo;ll see what
happens. You keep watch, and let me know when
I come back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He handed the binoculars to Fenn, and went
below. The four chums took turns looking at
the on-coming craft. Presently they noticed that
their own steamer was making faster progress
through the water.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
&ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;ll leave &rsquo;em behind now,&rdquo; observed
Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then you&rsquo;ve got another guess coming,&rdquo; responded
Fenn. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve put on more steam.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The other boat seemed to spurt through the
waves that were piled up in front of her sharp
prow. She easily kept right after the <i>Modoc</i>, and
even seemed to approach closer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder what they&rsquo;ll do when they catch up
to us?&rdquo; asked Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait until they catch us,&rdquo; suggested Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, boys, how about it?&rdquo; called Captain
Wiggs, as he came on deck. &ldquo;Have you polished
up the anchor chain, as I asked you to. The
regular polisher-boy is sick, and I&rsquo;m short handed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You didn&rsquo;t tell us&mdash;&rdquo; began Fenn, when a
smile on the face of the commander warned him
that it was only a joke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How is our friend, the enemy?&rdquo; inquired
Captain Wiggs, reaching for the glass.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we haven&rsquo;t lost her,&rdquo; replied Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I see,&rdquo; observed the commander. &ldquo;I
think I&rsquo;ll have to try a little trick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He went to the pilot house and soon the <i>Modoc</i>
was sweeping away from her course in a long,
graceful curve.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
&ldquo;There, now we&rsquo;ll see if they are following us,
or whether they are just on the same course by
accident, and are using us for pace-makers,&rdquo; remarked
the captain, as he came back to where the
boys were.</p>

<p>In less than a minute the course of the pursuing
vessel was also changed, and on she came, after
the <i>Modoc</i>, the black smoke pouring from her
funnel, testifying to the fact that the engine room
force was piling on the fuel to make more steam.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s going to catch us or burst her boilers,&rdquo;
remarked the captain, with a grim smile. &ldquo;Well,
we&rsquo;ll see. I made them show their hand. They
evidently believe we&rsquo;re bound for the Canadian
shore, and they think they have us outside the
protection of the United States now, and can do
as they please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He hurried to the pilot house, and soon there
were several signals of the engine room bells.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see if we can&rsquo;t get a few more knots
out of her,&rdquo; observed the commander as he came
back, and took a hurried look at the yacht astern.
&ldquo;I guess the <i>Modoc</i> has some speed left in her
yet, even if she is only a freighter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>True, the big steamer did go faster, but so did
the pursuing boat. The chase was leading straight
toward Canada now.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t seem to shake &rsquo;em off,&rdquo; murmured the
captain, with a somewhat worried look on his
face. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a good notion to lay-to, and see what
they want.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked the captain quickly. &ldquo;You
haven&rsquo;t done anything wrong; have you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I think I&rsquo;ll just ask them the meaning
of this unwarranted chase. They haven&rsquo;t any
right to keep after me like this, unless they&rsquo;re a
government vessel, and they&rsquo;re not that or they
would have shown their colors long ago. That&rsquo;s
what I&rsquo;ll do. I&rsquo;ll stop!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He turned toward the pilot house to give the
order. Fenn took up the binoculars, which the
captain had laid down, and looked through them
at the strange steam yacht. He could make out
the two men on deck, one of them&mdash;he with the
sinister face&mdash;staring at the little knot of boys,
who seemed, so unaccountably, to have become
involved in a mystery.</p>

<p>Following the ringing of the engine room bells,
the <i>Modoc&rsquo;s</i> speed began to slacken. Captain
Wiggs came back to where the boys were and
remarked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;ll see what will happen.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
Hardly had he spoken than there sounded from
the pursuing craft, which had not slackened speed,
a shrill hissing. Then a white cloud appeared to
hover over her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s broken a steam pipe!&rdquo; cried the captain.
&ldquo;Too much pressure! I thought she couldn&rsquo;t
stand it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The strange craft was almost lost to sight in
the cloud of white vapor that enveloped her, while,
from the midst of it, came excited cries.</p>



<hr class="cb" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI"></a>CHAPTER XI</h2>

<h3>ON LAKE HURON</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Somebody&rsquo;s hurt!&rdquo; cried Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t wonder,&rdquo; replied Captain Wiggs,
coolly. &ldquo;There generally is when an explosion
occurs in a boiler room.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t we going to help them?&rdquo; inquired
Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll give them any aid they need,&rdquo; said the
commander. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll see how much the damage
amounts to. I&rsquo;ll steam back toward &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He gave the necessary orders, and soon the
<i>Modoc</i> was slowly approaching the disabled craft.
The clouds of steam had somewhat dispersed, but
that something was wrong was evident from the
manner in which men were hurrying about the
deck of the recent pursuing yacht.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess it wasn&rsquo;t as bad as I thought,&rdquo; remarked
Mr. Wiggs. &ldquo;They seem to have stopped
the leak in the pipe. I hope none of the men
are badly scalded. I&rsquo;ll offer &rsquo;em help, and they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
can take it or leave it. They&rsquo;ve made enough
trouble for me as it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the strange craft evidently did not desire
any aid, nor did the commanders of it seem to
court any investigation of what had happened.
As the <i>Modoc</i> approached the other boat&rsquo;s whistle
sounded, and then it slowly started off, like a lame
dog running away from a fight with a superior
antagonist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Had enough, eh?&rdquo; remarked the captain.
&ldquo;I thought so. Well, I&rsquo;m not sorry that I don&rsquo;t
have to get to close quarters with them. It looks
as if it was coming on to blow, and it&rsquo;s no joke to
have to tow a disabled boat on Lake Erie in a
storm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Seeing that his proffered offer of help was declined
Captain Wiggs changed the course back to
his original one. As the other craft turned about,
and steamed slowly away, Fenn watched through
the glass, and the last thing he could see was
the man with the ugly face, standing at the stern,
gazing at the <i>Modoc</i> through a telescope.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll know me next time, anyhow,&rdquo; thought
Fenn, as he joined his chums, who were talking of
the strange finish of the chase.</p>

<p>Discuss the recent happenings as they did, from
all sides, the boys could not get at the bottom of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
them. No more could Captain Wiggs. But he
soon found he had other things to think about than
the chase which had ended so abruptly, for the
weather changed suddenly, and there were indications
of a heavy storm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to make the Detroit River before the
blow comes on hard,&rdquo; he remarked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got
a pretty heavy load aboard, and the <i>Modoc</i>, while
she&rsquo;s a stanch craft, doesn&rsquo;t behave as well in a sea
as she might. I&rsquo;ve lost considerable time through
that elevator fire, and stopping on account of those
men chasing us, so I must make it up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The steamer was sent ahead at full speed, but
the storm developed faster than the captain had
calculated so that, when still several miles from
a good harbor, the wind suddenly swooped out
of the west and soon there was a heavy sea running.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s almost like the ocean,&rdquo; remarked
Ned as, standing well forward, near the port rail,
he looked across the lake and saw the big waves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll think so, if this keeps up,&rdquo; responded
Captain Wiggs. &ldquo;Lake Erie can kick up as pretty
a storm as I ever want to see, and I&rsquo;ve been
through some hard ones, I can tell you. This
is nothing to what it will be if the wind increases.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And that the wind intended increasing was evident<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
from the way it howled over the big expanse
of water, which was dotted with white-caps.
Through the waves the <i>Modoc</i> labored, her powerful
engines and screw sending her ahead gallantly,
though she rolled and pitched in a way to
make the boys think they were on an ocean liner
instead of a lake steamer.</p>

<p>It grew quite dark, partly because of the clouds
that gathered, and because evening was approaching.
Then the rain, which had held off for a
while, came down with a suddenness that was almost
like a cloud burst. Fortunately the boys, on
the advice of the captain, had donned oil-skins,
and they were protected, though sometimes it
seemed as if the wind would drive the rain drops
right through their garments.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a terrible storm!&rdquo; exclaimed Ned, as
he held on to the rail and tried to peer ahead
through the mist and blackness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait!&rdquo; fairly shouted the captain. &ldquo;You
haven&rsquo;t seen any more than the beginning.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough for me!&rdquo; cried Fenn, as he
made his way to the companionway and went below.
The other boys followed, as the commander
said it was hardly safe on deck. The <i>Modoc</i>
was now laboring amid the big waves. The
lookout, scanning the waste of waters for a sight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
of land, could see nothing but blackness ahead.</p>

<p>It did not seem quite so bad to the boys, after
they were in the cabin, though they had to sit
braced in chairs to avoid tumbling out when the
vessel pitched and tossed, and it was quite a task
to move about, for there was danger of bringing
up against some piece of furniture, or the cabin
partitions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;An ocean voyage isn&rsquo;t in it with this,&rdquo; declared
Ned. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s great!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It may be, but it makes me feel sick,&rdquo; declared
Fenn. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to lie down in my
bunk.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This he did, saying he felt better when stretched
out. The other boys followed his example, as the
pitching was a little too much for them. They
soon grew accustomed to it, however, and presently
they noticed that the motion seemed less violent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must have come to anchor,&rdquo; said Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;More likely we&rsquo;re inside some harbor,&rdquo; declared
Ned.</p>

<p>They went up on deck and found that, though
it was still raining hard, the wind had died down
a little, which made the boat ride easier.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are we?&rdquo; called Fenn, to Captain
Wiggs, who was pacing the deck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
&ldquo;Just entering the Detroit River,&rdquo; was the reply.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll tie up at Detroit for the night.
How are you, boys?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Better now,&rdquo; replied Ned.</p>

<p>As soon as the <i>Modoc</i> was well within the river
the effects of the blow were no longer noticeable.
In a short time the steamer was tied up at a dock
and the boys turned in for the night.</p>

<p>Captain Wiggs had some business to transact
in Detroit, and spent nearly all of the next day
there, giving the boys a chance to go ashore and
see some of the sights. They resumed their trip
that evening, through Lake St. Clair, and proceeding
without stop to Lake Huron.</p>

<p>Emerging well out upon this vast body of inland
water, the boys, one bright morning, got a
fine view of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it&mdash;isn&rsquo;t it big!&rdquo; exclaimed Fenn.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s simply&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Help him out, Ned,&rdquo; suggested Bart. &ldquo;You
ought to have some big adjectives on hand, left
over from that last French history lesson. This
is too much for Stumpy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It certainly is a lot of water,&rdquo; commented
Frank. &ldquo;I thought Lake Erie was big, but this
seems to beat it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys stood at the rail, absorbed in the contemplation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
of the beautiful scene before them.
Captain Wiggs too, though he had viewed the lake
many times, could not but admire the beauty of it
as it sparkled in the morning sun.</p>

<p>One of the men from the engine room suddenly
appeared on deck, and, standing behind the commander,
who was explaining something to the
boys, waited until the captain had finished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you wish to see me?&rdquo; asked Mr. Wiggs,
turning to the man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. Mr. McDougall told me to ask you
to step below, sir.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the trouble?&rdquo; for the man seemed a
little uneasy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know exactly, sir, but I think it&rsquo;s a
leak.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A leak?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir. Mr. McDougall thinks some of
the forward plates have started.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must have been the storm,&rdquo; commented
Captain Wiggs, as he hastened below. &ldquo;Yet it&rsquo;s
a good while taking effect. I hope it isn&rsquo;t serious.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>

<h3>NED GETS A FISH</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Hark!&rdquo; exclaimed Bart. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s that
sound?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The pumps!&rdquo; replied Fenn. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve
started &rsquo;em. It must be a bad leak. We&rsquo;d better
get life preservers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get excited,&rdquo; counseled Frank coolly.
&ldquo;Wait until you see how bad it is. These steamers
are all built with water-tight compartments,
and it would take quite a hole to make one of them
sink. The starting of a few plates wouldn&rsquo;t do
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His words calmed his chums, and, when Captain
Wiggs came on deck, a few minutes later, he announced
that the leak was not a serious one, though
it would be necessary to go ashore to make repairs.</p>

<p>It was found, on docking the <i>Modoc</i> that the
repairs would take about a week, and this period
the boys spent in making excursions on shore, in
the vicinity of the town. They had a good time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
and the delay did not seem very long because of
the many interesting sights.</p>

<p>They visited a large saw mill where the logs,
that had been brought down the lake in big rafts,
were cut up into lumber, and the foreman of the
plant showed them the various processes through
which the tree trunks went before they were turned
out in the shape of boards, planks or timbers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll start in the morning, boys,&rdquo; announced
Captain Wiggs one night. &ldquo;The <i>Modoc</i>
is in good shape again, and we&rsquo;ll have to make
good time from now on, because of our delays.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Early the next morning the vessel was under
way again. Out on Lake Huron it steamed,
plowing through the blue waters, under a sunny
sky, while a gentle breeze stirred up little waves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you boys do some fishing?&rdquo; asked
Captain Wiggs, as he noticed the four chums
sitting near the after rail, talking among themselves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t know we could catch anything
here,&rdquo; replied Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t either,&rdquo; was the captain&rsquo;s answer, &ldquo;but
you can&rsquo;t tell until you try. There is plenty of
tackle aboard, and you might land something nice.
There are fish in the lake&mdash;plenty of &rsquo;em. The
thing to do is to catch &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
The boys needed no other invitation, and soon
they had lines trailing over the stern of the ship,
far enough away from the screw to avoid getting
tangled in the blades. Mr. Ackerman, the sick
passenger, who has improved considerably, also
took a line, and joined the boys.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see who gets the biggest fish,&rdquo; proposed
Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see who gets the first one,&rdquo; supplemented
Bart. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the best test.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It did not look as if luck was going to be very
good, for the lines had been over half an hour,
and no one had had so much as a nibble.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is getting tiresome,&rdquo; spoke Ned, as he
assumed a more comfortable position in his chair.
Then he tied his line to his wrist, propped his feet
up on the rail, and lounged back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if that isn&rsquo;t a lazy way of fishing!&rdquo;
exclaimed Frank. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you sit up?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will when I get a bite,&rdquo; replied Ned.</p>

<p>They resumed their waiting, with that patience
which is, or ought to be, part of every angler&rsquo;s
outfit. Suddenly Frank nudged Bart and pointed
to Ned. The latter had fallen asleep in his chair.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s play a joke on him,&rdquo; proposed Fenn
in a whisper. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tie him fast in his chair.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, let&rsquo;s pull up his line and fasten an old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
shoe, or something like that to it,&rdquo; proposed
Frank. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll think he has a big bite.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They started to put this plan into operation,
when, as they were about to pull up Ned&rsquo;s line,
they saw it suddenly straighten out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got a bite!&rdquo; exclaimed Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and a whopper, too,&rdquo; added Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look at it!&rdquo; cried Bart, as some big fish, at
the stern of the boat, leaped out of the water and
fell back with a splash.</p>

<p>Then the line about Ned&rsquo;s wrist tightened. He
felt the pull and awakened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got him!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got the biggest
one!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The next moment he went sprawling from his
chair, while his arm was straightened out in front
of him, for the strong line, to which a big fish
was attached, was fairly pulling him along.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look out! He&rsquo;ll go overboard!&rdquo; cried Mr.
Ackerman.</p>

<p>Bart made one leap, and grabbed Ned around
the waist. This saved the luckless youth from
being pulled over the rail, but it did not release
him from his predicament.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh! Ouch!&rdquo; cried Ned. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s pulling my
arm off!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Indeed this seemed likely to happen, for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
line was very strong, and the lad had tied it securely
about his wrist. It could not slip over his
hand, and the fish on the other end was tugging
away for dear life. Doubtless it would have
been glad enough to escape, but it was fairly
caught, for as they afterward found, it had swallowed
Ned&rsquo;s bait, hook and all.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let go!&rdquo; yelled Ned to Bart, who was clinging
to his waist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I do you&rsquo;ll go overboard!&rdquo; replied Bart.
He felt his chum slipping from his grasp. &ldquo;Give
me a hand here!&rdquo; Bart called to Fenn and
Frank.</p>

<p>They jumped to his aid, while Mr. Ackerman,
in an excess of nervous fright, ran up and down
the deck shouting:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Captain! Captain Wiggs! Stop the ship!
A shark has got hold of one of the boys!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that? What&rsquo;s the trouble?&rdquo; asked
the commander, hurrying up from the cabin.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A shark has got Ned!&rdquo; repeated the invalid.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shark? In Lake Huron?&rdquo; replied the commander.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;re crazy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess it must be a whale, by the way it
pulls,&rdquo; said Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s one of the big lake fish!&rdquo; exclaimed the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
captain. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re as strong as a pony. Wait,
I&rsquo;ll cut the line!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; begged Ned, who, now that his
three chums had hold of him, was in no danger
of going overboard, though the thin, but tough
cord, was cutting deep into his wrist, where he
had foolishly tied it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, lend a hand!&rdquo; called Captain Wiggs to
a sailor who was passing. The man grabbed the
line with both hands and soon was able, with the
help which Frank and Fenn gave him, to haul in
the fish. It seemed as if they really had a shark
on the end of the line, but, when the finny specimen
was gotten on deck, it was seen that it was
not as large as the boys had imagined.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who would have thought it was so strong?&rdquo;
asked Ned, rubbing his chafed wrist.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The speed of the boat had something to do
with it,&rdquo; said the captain. &ldquo;You were pulling on
the fish broadside I guess, but it is a very strong
species even at that. They&rsquo;re not often caught
on a hand line.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are they good to eat?&rdquo; asked Ned, wishing
to derive some benefit from his experience.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Some folks like &rsquo;em, but they&rsquo;re a little too
strong for me,&rdquo; answered the captain. &ldquo;However,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
I think the crew will be glad to get it?&rdquo; and
he looked questioningly at the sailor who had
helped land the prize.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; replied the man, touching his cap.
He took the fish to the galley, where the cook
prepared it for the men&rsquo;s dinner. The boys tasted
it, but did not care for the flavor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you going to fish any more?&rdquo; asked
the captain, as he saw Ned coiling up his line,
after the fish had been taken away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s enough for one day,&rdquo; was the boy&rsquo;s
reply. &ldquo;The other fellows can, if they like. My
wrist is too sore.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lucky you didn&rsquo;t tie the line to your toe,&rdquo;
said Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because you&rsquo;d probably be walking lame now,
if you had. As it is you can&rsquo;t sign any checks for
a while, I s&rsquo;pose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you and your checks!&rdquo; exclaimed Ned,
in no mood to have fun poked at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Moral! Don&rsquo;t go to sleep while you&rsquo;re fishing,&rdquo;
said Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I did better than you fellows did. You
didn&rsquo;t get anything,&rdquo; retorted the fisherman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIII" id="CHAPTER_XIII"></a>CHAPTER XIII</h2>

<h3>CAUGHT IN THE LOCK</h3>


<p>Ned, at the suggestion of the captain, put some
salve on his wrist, for the cord had cut through
the flesh. Then he had Bart bandage it up. This
done the boys resumed their seats near the after
rail, and talked about Ned&rsquo;s exciting catch.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope you don&rsquo;t try such a thing again,&rdquo; remarked
Mr. Ackerman, as he came back from his
cabin. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a little too much for my nerves.&rdquo;
He sank down in a deck chair, and the boys noticed
that he was quite pale. He seemed unable
to get his breath.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you mind&mdash;would one of you mind,
reaching in my pocket and getting a bottle of
smelling salts that I carry,&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I think
if I took a sniff I&rsquo;d feel better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will,&rdquo; volunteered Fenn, for Mr. Ackerman&rsquo;s
hands hung limply by his side, and he
seemed incapable of helping himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this it?&rdquo; asked Fenn, as he reached in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
upper right hand pocket of the invalid&rsquo;s vest and
pulled out a small bottle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no,&rdquo; was the answer, half whispered.
&ldquo;That is my headache cure. I think it must be
in the lower pocket.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fenn replaced the headache cure and explored
the lower right-hand vest pocket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is this it?&rdquo; he inquired, drawing up a small
box.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no&mdash;my dear young friend&mdash;those are
my liver pills. Try again. I think it must be on
the other side.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He still seemed too weak to raise his hands.
Ned was about to call Captain Wiggs, but Fenn
made another try.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have it!&rdquo; he exclaimed, pulling out a shining
metal tube.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no,&rdquo; said the invalid faintly, opening
his eyes and looking at what Fenn held up.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s my asthma cure. Try the next pocket,
please.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, he&rsquo;ll kick the bucket if Fenn doesn&rsquo;t
find that medicine pretty soon,&rdquo; whispered Frank.
&ldquo;Guess I&rsquo;ll help him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fenn began a search of the lower left-hand vest
pocket. He brought up a bottle, containing a
dark liquid. Wishing to make sure he had the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
right stuff, he smelled of it, before asking Mr.
Ackerman to open his eyes and look at it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is that it?&rdquo; whispered Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Smells bad enough to be it,&rdquo; was Fenn&rsquo;s answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no. You haven&rsquo;t got it yet,&rdquo; spoke the
invalid, in peevish tones. &ldquo;That is my heart
remedy. I must kindly ask you to try again. I
remember now, it&rsquo;s in my right-hand coat pocket.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fenn replaced the heart cure and made one more
attempt. This time he brought up a short,
squatty, round bottle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rdquo; exclaimed the invalid joyfully,
&ldquo;Now, please hold it to my nose. Not too close.&rdquo;</p>

<p>However, he spoke too late, for Fenn had
placed the open phial right under Mr. Ackerman&rsquo;s
nose. The invalid gave one sniff, and then jumped
from the chair as if he was shot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wow! Ouch! Help!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
strong ammonia! I use it for hay fever. That&rsquo;s
the wrong medicine! Oh! The back of my
neck is coming off!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He held his handkerchief to his face, the tears
coming from his eyes because of the strong stuff.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I remember now!&rdquo; he managed to gasp. &ldquo;I
left my smelling salts in my stateroom. But I
can get them now. I&rsquo;m better&mdash;much better!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
&ldquo;I believe he is,&rdquo; remarked Frank, when Mr.
Ackerman had gone below. &ldquo;Say, isn&rsquo;t he the
limit, with his different kind of medicines?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t make fun of him,&rdquo; spoke Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; suddenly exclaimed the captain&rsquo;s
voice. &ldquo;I guess my invalid passenger must have
been around here,&rdquo; and he breathed in the ammonia-laden
air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He seems to be quite sick,&rdquo; said Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sick?&rdquo; repeated the commander. &ldquo;Say, I
wouldn&rsquo;t want him to hear me, but he&rsquo;s no more
sick than I am. He&rsquo;s only got a touch of hypochondriacism.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Will&mdash;will he die soon of it?&rdquo; asked Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Die? I wish I had his chance of living,&rdquo;
went on the captain. &ldquo;I guess you don&rsquo;t quite understand.
Maybe that word was too much for
you. A person who has hypochondriacism has a
little stomach trouble, and the rest is only imaginary.
That&rsquo;s what Mr. Ackerman has. Every
once in a while he takes a trip with me, for the
sake of his health, he says, but I think it&rsquo;s to get
away from working. Say, did he ask you to reach
in his pocket for some medicines for him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Fenn, &ldquo;and I had quite a time
finding it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
&ldquo;I should think you would. He&rsquo;s a regular
walking drug store. If he&rsquo;d throw all his
powders, pills and liquids away, and live out of
doors, he&rsquo;d be all right in a month. I&rsquo;m not making
fun of him, but I wish somebody would, some
day. Maybe it would cure him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He seemed pretty sick,&rdquo; ventured Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he was lively enough when he smelled
that ammonia I gave him by mistake,&rdquo; said Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ammonia?&rdquo; questioned the commander, and
the boys then told him what had happened. &ldquo;Ha!
Ho!&rdquo; laughed Captain Wiggs. &ldquo;That is the
best joke yet! Ammonia! Oh my! I&rsquo;ll bet he
was lively! Why, I can smell it yet!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The little experience seemed to do Mr. Ackerman
good, and it was several days before he complained
again. Then he was seemingly as badly
off as ever, taking some sort of medicine almost
every hour. But the boys understood him now,
and did not waste so much sympathy on him.</p>

<p>The <i>Modoc</i> steamed on, covering many miles
over Lake Huron until, towards evening one afternoon,
Captain Wiggs announced that morning
would find them at the entrance of St. Mary&rsquo;s
river, the connecting link between Lakes Huron
and Superior.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
&ldquo;Can you boys stand a little jarring?&rdquo; he
asked, as they were in the main cabin, after supper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jarring? Why?&rdquo; inquired Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because we&rsquo;ve got to jump the ship over St.
Mary&rsquo;s falls, and we don&rsquo;t always make it the first
time,&rdquo; was the answer, given with much gravity.
&ldquo;Often we miss and fall back, and it jars the ship
up quite a bit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, are we going through the &lsquo;Soo&rsquo; canal?&rdquo;
asked Fenn eagerly, for he had been reading up
about the Great Lakes, just before coming on the
trip.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the only way of getting around the
falls,&rdquo; replied the captain. &ldquo;I see you don&rsquo;t put
much faith in my jumping story.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We have to go through a lock, don&rsquo;t we?&rdquo;
Bart wanted to know.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Captain Wiggs, spreading a map
out on the table, &ldquo;we go through the canal, and
lock, being raised up several feet, to the level of
Lake Superior. If all goes well we&rsquo;ll be through
the lock by noon to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do they call it the &lsquo;Soo&rsquo; canal?&rdquo; asked
Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because it is named after the falls,&rdquo; was the
commander&rsquo;s reply. &ldquo;The falls are called Sault<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
Saint Marie, and that word which is spelled
&lsquo;S-a-u-l-t&rsquo; is pronounced as if it were spelled
&lsquo;S-o-o.&rsquo; It is a French word, and means a leap,
or water-fall. So you see when you say &lsquo;Sault
(Soo) Saint Marie&rsquo; you are really saying &lsquo;St.
Mary&rsquo;s Waterfall.&rsquo; The canal, and the city located
along it, both take the name of the falls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys were up early the next morning to
catch the first glimpse of the canal, lock and falls.
It was some time before they reached them, however,
and, when they did arrive at the canal, they
found several vessels ahead of them, and had to
wait their turn for entering the lock.</p>

<p>They had a fine view of the surrounding country
and the falls of St. Mary&rsquo;s, spanned by a big
railroad bridge. When they approached the lock,
they saw that the canal was there divided by two
walls of masonry making two locks and enclosing
a space that was laid out like a little park, with
grass plots and trees. Along the edges of the retaining
walls, which were very wide, many persons
were walking.</p>

<p>At last it was the turn of the <i>Modoc</i> to enter
the lock. She steamed slowly ahead, and an
empty grain barge was also sent in at the same
time, the lock being large enough for two vessels.</p>

<p>When the craft were in, the immense gates<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
were closed behind them. The <i>Modoc</i> and the
grain barge were now shut up in something like a
box of masonry, with water for a bottom, and the
sky for a top. The boys watched the men open
the water-gates that let in a flood of liquid that
swept in from Lake Superior, through the long
canal.</p>

<p>Slowly the two vessels began to rise. The water
boiled and bubbled, churning into foam as it forced
its way in. It seemed as though it was protesting
at being made to hoist the ships, instead of
being allowed to course on to the mighty ocean.</p>

<p>Up and up went the great craft, being lifted as
easily by the powerful water, as though some giant
hand had reached down from the sky and was elevating
them. A few feet more and they would be
able to steam out on the upper lever of the canal,
and thence into Lake Superior.</p>

<p>Suddenly a rope, that held the grain barge from
drifting too close to the forward gates, parted.
The churning of the water sent the clumsy craft
ahead, and, in a moment the bow was caught under
one of the heavy beams of the gate. As the
water was still lifting, the nose of the craft became
depressed, while the stern rose. Then the barge
swung over against the <i>Modoc</i>, and a projection
on it caught against the latter craft.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
The barge was now held down, bow and stern,
while, from beneath, it was being lifted by an irresistible
force of water. The barge careened to
one side, and the <i>Modoc</i> began to heel over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shut off the water!&rdquo; cried Captain Wiggs,
who saw the danger. &ldquo;Shut her off, quick, or
we&rsquo;ll be stove in!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV</h2>

<h3>MYSTERIOUS STRANGERS</h3>


<p>Under the forward gates, and through openings
in them, the water was still bubbling and
foaming, seeking to establish a level with that on
the other side of the barrier. Lower and lower
sank the bow of the barge, for it was held fast on
the beam. The <i>Modoc</i> heeled over more and
more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shut off the water!&rdquo; again cried the captain.</p>

<p>Then the attendants at the lock were made
aware that something was wrong. Orders were
shouted; men ran to and fro. With immense
levers they shut the flood gates, and, slowly and
sullenly, as though cheated of its prey, the bubbling
subsided.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must pull the barge back!&rdquo; cried one of
the lock men, running up along the cement wall.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t do that,&rdquo; advised Captain Wiggs,
as he stood on the bridge of his vessel, while the
boys, who were much alarmed by the impending<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
accident, had joined him, for they were permitted
the run of the ship.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked the man. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got
to free her from that gate beam.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, but if you pull her out from under the
edge of that beam suddenly, she&rsquo;s sure to bound
up, and then she&rsquo;ll come slap-bang against the
side of my craft. Besides, I think she&rsquo;s held so
tight that you can&rsquo;t pull her back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What shall we do?&rdquo; asked the man, recognizing
that Captain Wiggs knew what he was about.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let the water out from the rear gate,&rdquo; was his
suggestion. &ldquo;That will lower my vessel and the
barge gradually. They&rsquo;ll assume their right positions,
and no damage will be done. Then you
can raise us again, and be sure no more ropes
break. I don&rsquo;t want an accident like that again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The captain&rsquo;s advice was followed. When the
water ceased coming in the forward gate, the men
ran to the rear one and opened the valves there.
Out rushed the imprisoned fluid, boiling and bubbling
at a great rate. Slowly the two big vessels
began to sink. The barge swung away from the
<i>Modoc</i> and then, a little later, when the water
had fallen sufficiently, the bow was released from
the projecting beam. The two crafts were now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
in the same positions they had been in when they
first entered the lock.</p>

<p>Men hastily fastened heavier ropes to the barge,
and took several turns about strong bitts, so the
ship could not again drift into danger. Then the
flood was once more allowed to enter the lock.</p>

<p>Again the vessels rose, and this time, without
mishap, they were floated to the higher level of
the canal. The forward gates were opened and
out toward Lake Superior steamed the <i>Modoc</i>,
followed by the slower grain barge. The boys
looked around them, being able to get a better
view now, as they were some distance higher, being
on a level with the top of the falls, off to their
right. They saw a long string of vessels, some
waiting to enter the locks to proceed east, while
others were coming west.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was a narrow escape,&rdquo; remarked Bart,
when the ship was again proceeding along.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, we seem to be sort of up against lots of
hard luck this trip,&rdquo; remarked the captain. &ldquo;I
think you boys must be responsible.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; asked Fenn, for the captain looked
serious.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;re regular Jonahs. If there were
any whales in these waters I&rsquo;d try the experiment<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
of throwing one of you overboard, to see if I
couldn&rsquo;t change my luck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d be willing to jump over and take a swim,&rdquo;
volunteer Ned. &ldquo;It looks nice and cool in there,
and it&rsquo;s hot up here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a warm July day, and the weather was
humid and unpleasant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe when we get further out on Lake Superior,
and come to some good place to tie up, I&rsquo;ll
give you a chance to take a dip,&rdquo; responded the
commander. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like one myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ned must take care not to go to sleep, or he&rsquo;ll
be carried under by a big fish,&rdquo; suggested Fenn,
taking precautions to get beyond the reach of his
chum&rsquo;s arm.</p>

<p>The <i>Modoc</i> touched at a port of call that afternoon,
and Captain Wiggs found awaiting him a
message which changed matters so that he did not
have to be in any hurry to conclude his voyage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This will give us a chance to lay-to, and go
ashore,&rdquo; he said to the boys. &ldquo;You might as well
have a good time while you are on this cruise.
No telling when you&rsquo;ll get another.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a day after this, one of the hottest that
the boys ever remembered, that the <i>Modoc</i> came
to anchor off shore, near a little bay, on the edge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
of which, and about three miles away from where
they laid-to, was a good-sized town.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now for a swim!&rdquo; exclaimed Ned. &ldquo;Can
we take the boat and go ashore, captain?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The desired permission being given, the four
chums were soon rowing toward where they saw
a sandy beach, that seemed to be put there on purpose
for bathing. They hauled the boat up on
shore and soon were disporting themselves in the
water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, this is something like!&rdquo; exclaimed Fenn,
as he proceeded to float with nothing but his face
out of the water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you look just like a baby crocodile,&rdquo; replied
Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do, eh?&rdquo; asked Fenn, diving suddenly and
coming up under Frank, whom he ducked unceremoniously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here! Quit-erurgle-gurgle!&rdquo; called the
luckless one, as he sank out of sight.</p>

<p>Then the boys began to play tricks on each
other, had impromptu races and diving contests,
and enjoyed themselves to the limit in the cool
water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s dress and go on a little exploring trip,&rdquo;
proposed Fenn, after they had spent an hour in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
the lake. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got time enough before we
have to go aboard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His suggestion was well received, and soon the
four chums were strolling back from the lake,
through the dense woods that bordered it. They
had not gone far before Frank, who was in advance,
suddenly halted. He motioned to the
others to approach silently, and they joined him
on tip-toe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Ned.</p>

<p>Frank pointed through the bushes. Beyond the
screen of the underbrush the boys could see a road.
It did not seem to be much traveled, but what attracted
their attention was a big automobile,
drawn back, and almost hidden in the thicket.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The machine&rsquo;s been abandoned,&rdquo; was Bart&rsquo;s
opinion. &ldquo;It is probably broken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; cautioned Frank, and not a moment
too soon, for, at that instant two men stepped cautiously
out of the bushes near the auto. One of
them produced a telescope, and pointed it at the
lake, which was just visible through the trees.</p>

<p>The boys looked at the man. He seemed a
rough sort of fellow, with an unpleasant face. He
was poorly dressed, and the lads noticed that,
standing against a tree near him, was a rifle.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
But it was a sight of the man&rsquo;s companion which
caused the boys to stare again and wonder. For
the second man was a Chinese, though he wore
American clothes. Under his hat, however, could
be seen the tell-tale queue.</p>

<p>The white man handed his Celestial companion
the telescope, and murmured something to him,
evidently in Chinese. The other replied and applied
the glass to his eye. No sooner had he done
so that he uttered an exclamation, and began jumping
about.</p>

<p>The other man snatched the glass and took a
look. Then they both talked very excitedly,
pointing to the lake and then at the auto.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder what they can be up to?&rdquo; whispered
Fenn.</p>

<p>At that moment he stepped on a loose branch.
It broke with a sharp report, and the Chinaman
and the white man glanced to where the boys were
hidden.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; exclaimed Frank. &ldquo;They may
come after us!&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>

<h3>A QUEER FIND</h3>


<p>Off through the woods ran the Darewell
chums, and it needed but a moment&rsquo;s listening to
tell them that the two mysterious men were after
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurry!&rdquo; called Frank to Fenn, who, because
of his natural inability, was not able to run as
fast as could the others. &ldquo;Come on, or they&rsquo;ll
catch you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see&mdash;what we&rsquo;ve done&mdash;that we&mdash;should
run,&rdquo; panted the stout youth. &ldquo;These
woods&mdash;are free. Why haven&rsquo;t we&mdash;a right to
walk in them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is out west and they do things differently
from what they do where we come from,&rdquo; responded
Bart, looking back. &ldquo;Evidently those
men didn&rsquo;t want to be observed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are they coming?&rdquo; asked Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Bart, pausing in his race, &ldquo;they
seemed to have stopped in that little clearing we
just passed through.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
&ldquo;The Chinese is trying to induce the white man
to come back,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>

<p>This was the case for, as the boys watched, they
saw the pig-tailed Celestial grasp his companion
by the arm, and, pointing toward the lake, fairly
pull him back along the path they had come.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They must be interested in some boat,&rdquo; suggested
Fenn. &ldquo;Say, fellows,&rdquo; he added hastily.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet I know what it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; inquired Bart, as he stooped over to
pick a lot of burdock burrs from his trousers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These men have something to do with the two
who chased us back at the elevator fire. I&rsquo;ll bet
they&rsquo;re part of the same gang, and they&rsquo;re trying to
work some trick on the <i>Modoc</i>! We ought to
hurry back and tell Captain Wiggs!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re &rsquo;way off!&rdquo; declared Frank. &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t believe these men even know those who
chased us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then who are they?&rdquo; demanded Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Frank. &ldquo;Evidently they
are interested in some boat they expect from across
the lake. That is very evident from the way they
acted; looking through the telescope, and all that.
Perhaps they have mistaken our vessel for the one
they are looking for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; remarked Bart. &ldquo;I noticed when the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
Chinese pointed the glass he aimed it in a different
direction from that in which the <i>Modoc</i> lies.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then what boat are they expecting?&rdquo; asked
Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s too big a question for me,&rdquo; replied
Bart. &ldquo;It certainly is a queer thing to see a Chinese
and a white man in such close company, off here
in the woods.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And then the auto,&rdquo; put in Fenn. &ldquo;What
do you suppose that&rsquo;s for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s part of the same game,&rdquo; was Frank&rsquo;s
opinion.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t know that it&rsquo;s up to us to discover
it,&rdquo; went on Fenn. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s about time we
got back to the ship, anyhow. Come on. We&rsquo;ll
keep on this way, and fetch around to the beach
in a circle. Then we&rsquo;ll not run across those two
queer men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys advanced, laying their course as best
they could. Now and then, through the trees,
they could get a glimpse of the lake, and they
knew they were going in the right direction.</p>

<p>They came to a little gully, in a dense part of
the woods, and had to descend into it, to get
across, as it extended for quite a distance in either
direction. Frank led the way, half slipping, half
sliding down the sides. As he reached the bottom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
he gave a startled cry that alarmed his companions.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurt yourself?&rdquo; asked Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but look what I&rsquo;ve found!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A gold mine?&rdquo; inquired Ned, with a laugh.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Part of a clothing store,&rdquo; replied Frank.
&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; and he pointed to where, behind a
clump of trees, was a large pile of men&rsquo;s clothing,
hats, shoes, coats, vests, trousers and shirts.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That solves the mystery!&rdquo; exclaimed Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; asked Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why there&rsquo;s been a big robbery! The men
have hidden their booty in the woods, until they
have a chance to carry it away. Those two men
we just saw are members of the gang. They&rsquo;re
keeping a look-out until their boat comes and
then they&rsquo;ll take the stuff away. Yes, that&rsquo;s
it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe Fenn&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; declared Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you?&rdquo; asked Frank quietly. &ldquo;Then how
do you account for the fact that all the garments
are old? There&rsquo;s not a new one among &rsquo;em, not
even the shoes. You can see for yourself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys looked more closely at the garments,
which were arranged in piles, with canvas coverings
tossed to one side, as though they had been
protected from the weather, and recently opened.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
They did not touch the things, but it did not need
a close inspection to show that Frank was right.
The garments were all old ones.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If there was a robbery it must have been of a
second-hand store,&rdquo; went on Frank, &ldquo;and that&rsquo;s
not likely. Besides, see here,&rdquo; and he pointed a
little farther off, where a heap of Chinese clothing
lay on the ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, if this doesn&rsquo;t beat the Dutch!&rdquo; exclaimed
Bart. &ldquo;What do you make out of
that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was a strange find. First to come across a
Chinese and an American, in excited conversation
in the depths of the woods, and then to discover a
pile of clothes, such as are worn by white men,
close to a heap, evidently discarded by a band of
Celestials, was sufficient, as Bart said, to beat not
only the Dutch, but the French, English, German,
Spanish and a few other nations.</p>

<p>The boys went closer to the garments of the
Celestials. These clothes, as did the others, exhibited
unmistakable signs of wear. But they
were not piled in orderly heaps; instead, being
tossed carelessly together, as if they were no longer
of any service.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t this a regular Chinese puzzle?&rdquo; remarked
Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
&ldquo;I believe they are Chinese smugglers!&rdquo; chorused
Fenn and Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what,&rdquo; said Frank. &ldquo;Those two men
we saw were evidently the look-outs, watching for
the boat load to arrive. When the travelers from
the Flowery Kingdom land, they are brought here,
to this secluded place, and here they take off their
blouses and wide pants, and put on old American
clothes. Old ones, so they attract no attention.
I&rsquo;ll wager that&rsquo;s the solution to this Chinese puzzle.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But where do the Chinamen come from?&rdquo;
asked Ned. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re a good ways from China.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;From Canada,&rdquo; answered Frank. &ldquo;I remember
reading lately about a lot of Chinese who were
taken into Canada from the Pacific coast. They
were brought by rail to a place on Lake Superior
about opposite here, and smuggled into this country
in boats.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; agreed Bart. &ldquo;I read how
one boat load, which the smugglers were bringing
over, was caught in a storm, and all the Chinese
drowned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why do they bring them over?&rdquo; asked
Fenn, who was usually too full of fun, or too interested
in some girl, to pay much attention to
current events.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
&ldquo;Why, there&rsquo;s a United States law against letting
any more Chinese come in,&rdquo; explained Frank.
&ldquo;The only way they can get in is to smuggle here.
It&rsquo;s easy to get them into Canada, and then, if they
can make a trip across the lake, and land in some
secluded spot, they&rsquo;re all right, if they&rsquo;re not discovered,
and that is no easy matter, as the Chinese
all look so much alike.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then that white man we saw must have been
one of the agents engaged in smuggling,&rdquo; said
Bart. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve read they have a regularly organized
company, and get good money from the
Chinese whom they smuggle over. The pig-tailed
chap with him, was evidently a helper or interpreter,
who was on hand because the boat was expected.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why they were looking across the lake
with a telescope then,&rdquo; ventured Fenn. &ldquo;Say,
it&rsquo;s as clear as daylight now. I wonder if we
couldn&rsquo;t stay and see &rsquo;em land?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not much!&rdquo; exclaimed Frank. &ldquo;The
chances are the plans are all off, for the time being.
That white man will suspect we were spying
on him, and when they ran back that time, I guess
it was to signal to the boat not to land. We
must have given them quite a scare.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what was the auto for?&rdquo; asked Ned, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
liked to go into details, and who always wanted to
know the why and wherefore of things.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess it was to take the Chinese to some
place where they could stay until it was safe to
venture out,&rdquo; said Frank. &ldquo;Sometimes they have
to jump around pretty lively, I imagine, especially
if the government detectives get after them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps we&rsquo;d better go and tell Captain
Wiggs what we have discovered,&rdquo; suggested
Fenn. &ldquo;He may want to notify the authorities.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good idea,&rdquo; commented Bart. &ldquo;Come on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As the boys started to leave the little gully
where the clothing was hidden, they heard a noise
behind them. Turning quickly they saw the white
man and Chinese, as they broke through the underbrush.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re after us!&rdquo; exclaimed Fenn in a hoarse
whisper.</p>



<hr class="cb" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>

<h3>FIRE ON BOARD</h3>


<p>But this time it proved to be the other way
about. The two mysterious men, at the sight of
the boys, dived back into the woods again, and
showed no desire to come to closer acquaintance
with them. Instead of taking after the four
chums, the men acted as though they feared pursuit.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re running away from us!&rdquo; exclaimed
Frank. &ldquo;I guess we haven&rsquo;t anything to fear
from them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly, through the forest, there sounded a
shrill steam whistle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Captain Wiggs, signalling to us,&rdquo; replied
Frank. &ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;ve stayed in the woods too
long. Come on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s the smugglers&rsquo; boat,&rdquo; suggested
Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess not,&rdquo; Frank remarked. &ldquo;They&rsquo;ve<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
been signalled to keep off. That was the <i>Modoc&rsquo;s</i>
whistle. I recognized it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frank&rsquo;s words proved correct, for, when the
boys reached the shore, they again heard the signal,
and saw steam coming from the whistle pipe
of the vessel on which they were cruising.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look there!&rdquo; exclaimed Frank, pointing off
to the left. The boys glanced in the direction,
and saw a boat. From the funnels black smoke
was pouring, as if every effort was being made to
get up steam. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s the smugglers&rsquo; craft, very
likely,&rdquo; the lad went on. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s making fast
time away from here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain Wiggs listened gravely to what the
boys had to tell him. He agreed with Frank, that
the smugglers of Chinese had tried to make a
landing, but, evidently, had been frightened off.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What will they do now?&rdquo; asked Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Change the landing place to some other locality,&rdquo;
replied the captain. &ldquo;Up or down the
coast. Up, I should say, seeing the way that
steamer&rsquo;s headed,&rdquo; and he pointed to the craft,
with the black smoke hanging like a cloud over
it. The vessel was almost out of sight.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What will they do with the clothes?&rdquo; asked
Bart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
&ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;ll take &rsquo;em along. Probably that&rsquo;s
what the two men came to get, when they saw
you and ran away. It&rsquo;s a well organized business,
this Chinese smuggling, and there is a lot of money
in it&mdash;for the agents. They are probably saying
all kinds of mean things about you, for breaking
up their plans.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then I hope they don&rsquo;t catch us alone off in
the woods, sometime,&rdquo; remarked Fenn. &ldquo;That
Chinese didn&rsquo;t look like a very pleasant fellow to
meet after dark; especially if he had a grudge
against you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you&rsquo;ve seen the last of &rsquo;em,&rdquo; declared
Captain Wiggs. &ldquo;If I thought it worth while I&rsquo;d
notify the government authorities, but, by the time
I could get a message to &rsquo;em, the smugglers will
be miles away. There&rsquo;s no telling where they&rsquo;ll
land next time. The steamer will hang around the
coast, until it gets a signal all is clear. Then the
pig-tails will be dumped into a boat, rowed ashore,
and the vessel will scoot off for another load in
Canada.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The anchor was broken out, hoisted, and soon,
under a good head of steam, the <i>Modoc</i> was proceeding
over Lake Superior at a fast rate, for,
though he carried no perishable freight, and had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
no special date of arriving at Duluth, Captain
Wiggs believed in doing what he had to do as
quickly as possible.</p>

<p>That night Fenn, who was not sleeping as
soundly as he should, in consequence of having
eaten too much supper, was awakened by hearing a
peculiar buzzing noise. At first he could not locate
it, and then, after sitting up in his bunk, he
decided it came from the stateroom adjoining his,
and which had no occupant this voyage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It sounds like a hive of bees,&rdquo; he said to
himself. &ldquo;I wonder if the captain can have any
in there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then the absurdity of such an idea was apparent
to him, and he smiled at his notion. Still
the buzzing continued, growing louder. Fenn
was wide awake now.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe something is wrong with the ship,&rdquo; he
reasoned. &ldquo;That sound might be water coming
in through a leak. I think I&rsquo;ll tell the captain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He got up, and, moving about his stateroom, in
search of his trousers and slippers, he knocked a
glass out of the rack.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; called Frank, who was a light
sleeper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s me,&rdquo; replied Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? Sick?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
&ldquo;No, but I heard a funny sound, and I want
to find out what it is. Maybe the boat&rsquo;s sprung
another leak.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you&rsquo;re dreaming,&rdquo; commented Frank.
&ldquo;Go back to bed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, you come in here and listen, if you think
I&rsquo;m dreaming,&rdquo; retorted Fenn.</p>

<p>Frank jumped out of his berth and came into
his chum&rsquo;s room. The buzzing had increased in
intensity, and Frank had no difficulty in hearing
it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did I tell you?&rdquo; asked Fenn, in triumph.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is a queer sound,&rdquo; admitted Frank.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s in that next room?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing, that I know of. I passed it
this morning, the door was open, and it was
empty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then let&rsquo;s have a look,&rdquo; suggested Frank,
stepping out into the passage.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe you&rsquo;d better&mdash;maybe it&rsquo;s a&mdash;&rdquo; stammered
Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, what?&rdquo; demanded Frank. &ldquo;Are you
afraid?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s an infernal machine those smugglers
put aboard,&rdquo; went on Fenn. &ldquo;It sounds just
like one.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
&ldquo;How do you know how an infernal machine
sounds?&rdquo; asked Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I mean like I&rsquo;ve read of their sounding.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s different. But this is no such
thing. Besides, how could the smugglers get one
aboard? They haven&rsquo;t been near the ship.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was, of course, unanswerable, and Fenn
followed Frank into the corridor, and to the door
of the stateroom, whence sounded the peculiar
buzzing noise. As they stood outside the portal
it could be heard more plainly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here goes!&rdquo; whispered Frank, turning the
knob.</p>

<p>Both he and Fenn started back in surprise, at
the sight which greeted them. There, sitting in
a steamer chair, in a big red bath robe, was the
invalid, Mr. Ackerman. On the bunk in front of
him was a small box, from which extended cords,
terminating in shining metal tubes, which he held
in his hand. The buzzing was coming from the
small box.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, boys, I&rsquo;m glad to see you!&rdquo; exclaimed the
man who thought he was sick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; asked Frank, in some
alarm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m taking a current of electricity, from my
medical battery,&rdquo; was the answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Electricity?&rdquo; repeated the two chums, in
questioning accents.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, from the battery. You see I couldn&rsquo;t
sleep, and I often find a current of electricity is
beneficial. I did not want to awaken Captain
Wiggs with the buzz of my machine, for it makes
quite a noise, so I brought it into this empty stateroom.
I hope I didn&rsquo;t disturb you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mr. Ackerman did not wait for the boys to answer.
Instead he continued:</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I&rsquo;m glad you came in. I want to take a
stronger current, and it goes better if I have some
one to share it with me. If you will be so kind,
you can each take one of the tubes in your hand,
and I will take hold of your other hands. Thus
we will form a circle, with me in the center. I
think I shall be able to get a current then, that
will cause me to go to sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys were a little apprehensive, for,
though they had taken electric &ldquo;shocks&rdquo; at school,
during the experiments, they did not care for the
amusement. However, they did not like to refuse,
so, rather gingerly, Fenn grasped one handle,
and Frank the other. Mr. Ackerman then did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
something to the battery which made it buzz
louder than ever.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All ready,&rdquo; he announced, as he grasped
Fenn&rsquo;s right hand in his left and Frank&rsquo;s left in
his right.</p>

<p>The instant that he did so it seemed as if the
trio had been hit by something. They all doubled
up, the arms of the boys and the invalid jerking
like the legs of a frog.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ow!&rdquo; cried Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let go!&rdquo; called Frank.</p>

<p>But there was no need for any one to let go.
With an exclamation of great astonishment, Mr.
Ackerman jerked his hands from the involuntary
grip of the boys&rsquo;. That at once broke the circuit,
and the current ceased to have any effect. The
machine was still buzzing away, however.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear! Oh, dear!&rdquo; murmured the invalid.
&ldquo;I meant to turn on the weak current,
and I turned on the strong one! Did you get bad
shocks, boys?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did we!&rdquo; exclaimed Fenn. &ldquo;Say, it feels
as if I had eaten some strong horse-radish by mistake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems as if a mule kicked me,&rdquo; remarked
Frank, rubbing his arms.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry,&rdquo; apologized Mr. Ackerman.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
&ldquo;I really did not intend that. I hope you believe
I did not.&rdquo; He seemed quite distressed over
the happening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; spoke Fenn, good-naturedly.
&ldquo;We know it was an accident.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rather a fortunate accident, too,&rdquo; went on
the invalid. &ldquo;My nerves are much calmer now.
I really think I shall be able to go to sleep. I
must have taken the right kind of a current without
knowing it. I&rsquo;ll do it the next time I find
myself too wakeful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Please excuse us from helping,&rdquo; begged
Frank, with a smile. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a little too much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, I wouldn&rsquo;t think of shocking you
again,&rdquo; said Mr. Ackerman as he began to take
the battery apart for packing. &ldquo;I shall take the
current alone. But there, I must not talk or I
shall be awake again. I must hurry and get to
sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t he the limit!&rdquo; exclaimed Fenn, when
he and Frank were back in the stateroom again.
&ldquo;He thinks that was fun for us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The electrical treatment appeared to improve
the sick man, for, the next day he was much
better, and even laughed and joked about the
night&rsquo;s experience.</p>

<p>The <i>Modoc</i> continued on her course, putting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
many knots behind her, and the boys were more
and more delighted with their cruise, which every
day revealed to them new beauties of scenery.</p>

<p>One afternoon, when they were within a day&rsquo;s
travel of Duluth, Captain Wiggs, who was sitting
on deck with the four chums, arose suddenly and
began to sniff the air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? Is the cook burning the
steak?&rdquo; asked Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Something&rsquo;s burning,&rdquo; answered the commander,
with a grave face.</p>

<p>A moment later a sailor, much excited, came
rushing up on deck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fire in the forward hold, sir!&rdquo; he called.</p>



<hr class="cb" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII</h2>

<h3>A STRANGE VISION</h3>


<p>Captain Wiggs was not built on speed lines.
He was short and squatty, and inclined to be fat.
But the way in which he hustled about as soon
as he heard what the sailor said was sufficient to
qualify him to enter a go-as-you-please race of almost
any kind.</p>

<p>With a few jumps he was at the companionway
leading below, and, as he went the boys could hear
him call out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ring the fire alarm! Every man to his station!
Someone tell the pilot to slow down!
Signal to the engineer to get the pumps in gear!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nor were the members of the crew slow to
carry out the commander&rsquo;s instructions. One man
rang the automatic fire alarm, that sounded in
every part of the vessel. Another hurried to the
bridge, where he delivered the message about stopping
the boat. The <i>Modoc</i> at once began to lose
way and, a moment later, the vibration from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
engine room told the boys that the pumps had
been started.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go below and see if we can help,&rdquo; suggested
Bart, and the four chums went down in a
hurry. They found men dragging lines of hose
forward where little curls of smoke began coming
from an open hatchway.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Drown her out, men!&rdquo; cried the captain.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be all day with us if the flames get loose in
that dry freight!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Several of the men, dragging the snaky lines of
hose, dropped down into the hold. They called
for water, and the captain signalled for it to be
turned on. The flat hose bulged out like a snake
after a full meal, and a splashing sound from below
told that the quenching fluid was getting in
its work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can we do anything?&rdquo; asked Fenn, as he saw
Captain Wiggs taking off his coat and donning
oil skins.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not now, I guess. You might stand by for
orders though. There&rsquo;s no telling into what this
will develope.&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was getting quite smoky below, and the hold,
down into which the commander had disappeared,
was pouring out a volume of black vapor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell &rsquo;em to send another line of hose!&rdquo; came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
a voice from below, and Fenn hurried to the engineer&rsquo;s
room with the order.</p>

<p>Several men sprang at once to obey. The hose
was unreeled from a rack on the partition, and
run out to the hold. Then the engineer started
another pump, that had been held in reserve.</p>

<p>There were now three lines of hose pouring
water on the flames, which the boys could not see.
That the blaze was not succumbing so quickly as
had been hoped for, was evident by the shouts and
excitement that came from the depths of the ship.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell &rsquo;em to give us more water!&rdquo; yelled the
captain to the boys waiting above.</p>

<p>Frank rushed with the order, glad to escape the
smoke, which was momentarily growing thicker.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell him he&rsquo;s got all the water I can give
him!&rdquo; shouted the engineer, above the noise of
the clanking machinery. &ldquo;One of the pumps has
gone out of commission!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frank shouted what the engineer had said to
Captain Wiggs, below in the darkness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then we&rsquo;ve got to batten down the hatches
and turn live steam into this hold!&rdquo; was what the
commander called back. &ldquo;Tell him to get up a
good head!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frank did so. When he returned Captain
Wiggs was just making his way out of the hold.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
He was black, and smoke-begrimed, while he dripped
water from every point of his yellow garments.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is there any danger?&rdquo; asked Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There always is with a fire aboard a ship,&rdquo;
answered the commander. &ldquo;But I think we&rsquo;ll be
able to hold her down if we get plenty of steam.
Come on up, men,&rdquo; he added, and the sailors
scrambled up. They looked more like colored,
than white men.</p>

<p>Captain Wiggs acted quickly. When the last
man was up, the hatches, or coverings to the hold,
were fastened down, and tarpaulins, wet with water,
to make them air tight, were spread over the
top. Then, from pipes which ran into the hold
from below, and which were for use in emergency,
jets of live steam were blown into the compartment.</p>

<p>This, the commander knew, would penetrate to
every nook and corner, reaching where water could
not, and would soon quench the flames.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, all we can do is to wait,&rdquo; said the captain,
as he sat down, for he was almost exhausted.</p>

<p>That was the hardest part of all. When one
can be busy at something, getting out of danger,
or fighting a fire that can be seen, the nervous fear
is swallowed up in action. But to sit and wait&mdash;wait<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>
for the unseen steam to do its work,&mdash;that
was very trying.</p>

<p>Still there was no help for it. Captain Wiggs
looked to the other part of the cargo, seeing that
there was no danger of that taking fire. The forward
hold was separated from the others by thick
bulkheads, and there was little chance of the fire
breaking through. The hull of the <i>Modoc</i> was
of steel, and, provided the fire did not get hot
enough to warp any of the plates, there was small
danger to the ship itself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to head for shore, in case it becomes
necessary to break out the cargo,&rdquo; decided
the captain, as he went on deck. &ldquo;Come on, boys.
We can do nothing now, and we want to get some
of this smoke out of our lungs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The course of the ship was changed. Captain
Wiggs got out his charts and looked them over.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where will we land?&rdquo; asked Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not much of anywhere,&rdquo; was the reply.
&ldquo;There is no good harbor this side of Duluth,
but I&rsquo;ve got to do the best I can. There is a little
bay, about opposite here. There&rsquo;s no settlement
near it, but I understand there&rsquo;s a good shore,
and I&rsquo;m going to make for it, in case this fire gets
beyond my control.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
Urged on by all the steam the engines could
take, though much was needed for the fire, the
vessel plowed ahead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Land ho!&rdquo; called the lookout, and the captain,
taking an observation, announced they were
close to the bay of which he had spoken. When
it was reached it was found to be a secluded harbor,
with nothing in sight on the shores of it save
a few old huts, that appeared to be deserted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a very lively place,&rdquo; commented the
captain. &ldquo;Still, it will do all right if we have to
land the cargo.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The anchor was dropped and then all there was
to do was to wait for the fire to be extinguished.</p>

<p>The boys remained on deck, looking at the
scenery about them. Back of the bay, rising almost
from the edge of the water, were a series of
steep cliffs, of bare rock for the most part, but
studded, here and there, with clumps of bushes
and small trees, that somehow, found a lodgement
for their roots on little ledges.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lonesome sort of place,&rdquo; remarked Fenn.
&ldquo;Not a soul within sight.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hardly had he spoken than there was seen on
the face of the cliff, as if by a trick, the figure of
a man. He seemed to come out, as does a magic-lantern
picture on a sheet, so quickly did he appear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
where, before, there had been nothing but
bare brown rock.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; exclaimed Fenn, pointing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A Chinaman!&rdquo; exclaimed Bart. &ldquo;One of
the smugglers!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys jumped to their feet, and approached
closer to the ship&rsquo;s rail, to get a better view.</p>

<p>As they did so the Chinese vanished as though
the cliff wall had opened and swallowed him up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>

<h3>AN EXPLORING PARTY</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you think of that?&rdquo; asked
Fenn, in surprised accents. &ldquo;Did he fall down?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Doesn&rsquo;t look so,&rdquo; answered Frank. &ldquo;I wonder
if we really saw him, or whether it was a sort
of day dream?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, we saw him all right enough,&rdquo; said Bart.
&ldquo;He looked to me just like the Chinaman we saw
in the woods that day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just what I was going to remark,&rdquo; put in
Ned. &ldquo;I wonder if there are any more men up on
that cliff?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, boys?&rdquo; asked Captain
Wiggs, approaching at this juncture. They told
him what they had seen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see anything very surprising in that,&rdquo;
replied the commander. &ldquo;Probably he has a
laundry up there, and he was out looking for customers.&rdquo;
And the commander winked at the other
chums, who joined in a laugh at Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right,&rdquo; announced the discomfited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
one. &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll wager there&rsquo;s something queer
back of all this. Do you know anything about
this locality, captain?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not a thing, and I wish I knew less. I&rsquo;d
never be here if it wasn&rsquo;t for the fire. And I
must take a look now, and see how our steam bath
is affecting it. I guess&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look there!&rdquo; suddenly cried Fenn, pointing
to the cliff, at the base of which the lake waves
were breaking.</p>

<p>They all looked. There, on the face of the
wall of rock, apparently supported by nothing,
stood four men, two of whom were Chinese, dressed
in the characteristic costume of that nation. The
others were white men. They were close together,
near a little clump of bushes, that sprang slantingly
out from the surface of the cliff.</p>

<p>&ldquo;More of &rsquo;em, eh?&rdquo; murmured the captain.
&ldquo;I wonder if they&rsquo;ll answer a hail?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He put his hands, trumpet fashion, to his mouth,
and was about to call out, when a surprising thing
happened.</p>

<p>As the boys watched the men seemed to grow
suddenly smaller. They fairly went down out of
sight, vanishing as completely as though they had
sank into the cliff.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I never saw such a queer thing!&rdquo; exclaimed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
Ned. &ldquo;They acted just like a Jack in the
Box, when some one shuts the lid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That expresses it exactly,&rdquo; admitted the captain.
&ldquo;It is a queer thing. I think it will bear
looking into. I wonder if they haven&rsquo;t something
to do with the Chinese smugglers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we thought.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe I&rsquo;ll go ashore and have a look,&rdquo; decided
the commander of the <i>Modoc</i>. &ldquo;The government
detectives ought to be told of what&rsquo;s going
on out here in this lonely place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Captain Wiggs would have carried his plan out,
but for the fact that an inspection of the hold
showed the fire in the cargo to be smothered.
The steam had done the work effectively and there
was no more danger. Instead of having to remain
in the secluded bay for some time, ready at
any moment, when danger threatened, to break
out the cargo, the commander found himself able
to proceed to Duluth.</p>

<p>This he decided on doing at once, as the exact
extent of the fire-damage could not be ascertained
until he reached a port where he could unload.</p>

<p>Accordingly all plans of making any examination
of the strange actions of the queer men were abandoned
and, steam having been gotten up in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
main boilers, the engines were started and the
<i>Modoc</i> was once more under way.</p>

<p>As they left the little bay the boys kept close
watch of the cliff, but there were no signs of life
upon the brown wall of rock. If the men were
somewhere within a cave on its surface, they did
not show themselves.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder if we&rsquo;ll ever solve that mystery?&rdquo;
inquired Bart, of no one in particular, as the four
chums paced the deck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to,&rdquo; announced Fenn, decidedly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, you&rsquo;re going to do a lot,&rdquo; returned Ned,
with a laugh. &ldquo;You were going to collect minerals,
but I haven&rsquo;t seen you stowing any away
lately, for your collection.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so, I forgot all about &rsquo;em,&rdquo; admitted
Fenn. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got lots of time, though. You can&rsquo;t
get any minerals out here,&rdquo; and he motioned to
the expanse of water that surrounded them. &ldquo;But
I&rsquo;m going to look into this Chinese business,
though.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; asked Frank. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re going farther
and farther away every minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right. We can come back,&rdquo; announced
Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought you were going to Bayville to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
Mr. Hayward, and&mdash;er&mdash;Miss Ruth,&rdquo; went on
Bart. &ldquo;Especially Ruth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I may yet,&rdquo; replied Fenn. &ldquo;Bayville
isn&rsquo;t so far from here. In fact it&rsquo;s within a short
distance of where we anchored in that bay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I asked the captain,&rdquo; replied Fenn. &ldquo;I was
thinking of taking a boat and rowing there, if we&rsquo;d
stayed long enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how do you figure on getting there now?&rdquo;
asked Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming back, after we get to Duluth,&rdquo;
was the answer. &ldquo;Captain Wiggs has got to remain
there for some time, and I don&rsquo;t see what
there is to keep us. It&rsquo;s a city, and we&rsquo;ve had
enough of city life for a while. I was going to
propose that, after we&rsquo;d been there a couple of
days, we go off on a little side trip, coming back
in time to go home on the <i>Modoc</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good idea!&rdquo; exclaimed Bart. &ldquo;We could
go on a little camping expedition.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That was my idea,&rdquo; added Fenn. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve
got enough money with us to hire a tent and a
small outfit, all we&rsquo;ll need for a week or so. We&rsquo;ve
been camping in the woods before, and we know
how to take care of ourselves. This cruising business
is fine, but it&rsquo;s too lazy a life to suit me.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
&ldquo;No, I s&rsquo;pose we haven&rsquo;t had any excitement
since we started,&rdquo; commented Frank sarcastically.
&ldquo;There was the elevator fire, those men chasing
us; Ned nearly being pulled overboard with a
fish; getting caught in the lock; the steamer on
fire and the queer men on the cliff. Oh, yes, we&rsquo;ve
lived a very quiet and sedate life since we left
home, Oh, yes, exceedingly quiet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I mean&mdash;Oh, you know what I mean,&rdquo;
said Fenn. &ldquo;We need more action&mdash;the kind
we&rsquo;ll get if we go off on a trip by ourselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rdquo; agreed Ned. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m with you,
Stumpy. The sooner the quicker.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;When do we get to Duluth?&rdquo; asked Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very soon now,&rdquo; answered Captain Wiggs,
who, coming up behind the boys, overheard the
question. &ldquo;I suppose you are all ready to enter
port?&rdquo; and he looked quizzically at the boys.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ready. How do you mean?&rdquo; asked Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why you can pass the quarantine regulations,
I suppose? Let me look at your tongues!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys were so surprised that, hardly knowing
what they were doing, they stuck them out for
the captain&rsquo;s inspection.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bad, very bad,&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have
to attend to this at once.&rdquo; And he laughed heartily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
&ldquo;Sold again!&rdquo; exclaimed Frank, as he drew
in his tongue. &ldquo;I thought we were going to get
even with him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So we are,&rdquo; declared Bart. &ldquo;If not now, on
the trip home. We owe him another one now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They were soon busy getting things in shape
to go ashore and, when the <i>Modoc</i> tied up at a
big wharf, they were all ready to go to the hotel
the captain had recommended, there to stay a
couple of days, until they could start on their little
exploring expedition.</p>

<p>The captain had offered no objection to this,
and had told them the best route to take.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you must be back in time to sail with me
on the homeward trip,&rdquo; cautioned the captain, mentioning
the date and time he expected to start.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not wait for you, remember. The <i>Modoc</i>
suffered very little damage from the fire. Less
than I feared and there will be no delay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be here on time,&rdquo; Fenn assured him.</p>

<p>The boys spent two busy days preparing for
their side trip, and, bright and early one morning,
they took a train that was to convey them to a
little settlement, whence they were to start for a
jaunt through the woods, carrying their simple
camping outfit with them.</p>

<h3>FENN BECOMES ILL</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Well, now, what&rsquo;s our program?&rdquo; asked
Frank when the four Darewell chums were in the
railroad train, speeding through the outskirts of
Duluth. &ldquo;I s&rsquo;pose Fenn will make a bee line for
Bayville and see Ruth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I intend to go there, not only to see Ruth,
but to see her father,&rdquo; announced Fenn coolly.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s no more than right, is it? He invited us
to come and see him, if we ever got out this way,
and here we are. It would be mean not to pay
a visit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, Stumpy,&rdquo; remarked Ned. &ldquo;We
know just how you feel about it,&rdquo; and he laughed,
whereat Fenn blushed, for he was rather sensitive
concerning his liking for young ladies.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Leaving Mr. Hayward out of it, what do you
intend to do, after we&rsquo;ve got our camp established?&rdquo;
asked Frank, looking at Fenn, with whom
this idea had originated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to see what those men were doing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
on the cliff,&rdquo; was the decided answer. &ldquo;Maybe
they were Chinese smugglers. If they were&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, if they were I s&rsquo;pose Stumpy will climb
up there single handed, make &rsquo;em all prisoners,
and then write a half-dime novel about it,&rdquo; put in
Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not exactly,&rdquo; answered Fenn. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see
what&rsquo;s to hinder me giving information to the government,
though, about the smugglers, if that&rsquo;s
what they are. I understand there&rsquo;s a reward for
that sort of information, and I could use a bit of
spare cash as well as any one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so!&rdquo; exclaimed Ned. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think
about that. I&rsquo;m with you, Stumpy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll want half the reward, I guess,&rdquo; interjected
Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; said Ned. &ldquo;Who wouldn&rsquo;t? Why
can&rsquo;t we all go in on this thing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course we can,&rdquo; declared Fenn. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
go camping somewhere back of that cliff, and then
we can&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hush! Not so loud!&rdquo; suddenly cautioned
Frank. Then, bending his head closer to his
chums, as they were sitting in two seats facing each
other he added: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a man a couple of seats
back who&rsquo;s been watching us pretty sharply ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
since we began talking this way. I don&rsquo;t like his
looks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is he?&rdquo; asked Fenn in a whisper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t look now,&rdquo; replied Frank, making a
pretense of pointing out the window at a bit of
scenery. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s staring right at us. It&rsquo;s the man
with the light hat, with a white ribbon band on,
whom I mean. You can size him up as soon as
he turns his head.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys cautiously waited for an opportunity,
and took a quick inspection of the man Frank had
indicated. He was a total stranger to the four
Darewell lads, as far as any of them knew, but
it did not take long to disclose the fact that the
man was much interested in them.</p>

<p>He watched their every move, and, when any
one of them spoke, the fellow tried to catch what
was said. The man seemed like an ordinary traveler,
and, except for a peculiar cast in one eye,
was not bad looking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s change our seats,&rdquo; suggested Fenn, when
the train had proceeded some miles farther, and
the car was not so full. &ldquo;We want to talk, and
we can&rsquo;t be whispering all the while.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They moved farther away from the man with
the cast in his eye, and were once more discussing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
their plans, when Frank again noticed that the
man was listening. He, too, had moved up several
seats, and, under pretense of reading a paper,
was straining his ears for whatever the boys said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go into the other car,&rdquo; proposed Fenn.
&ldquo;If he follows us there we&rsquo;ll tell the conductor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the man evidently did not care to run any
more risks and the boys were not further annoyed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder who he was?&rdquo; asked Ned. &ldquo;Perhaps
he had something to do with the smugglers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I guess he was just some fellow more
interested in the business of other persons than
in his own,&rdquo; replied Frank. &ldquo;I hope we didn&rsquo;t
talk too much, so that he&rsquo;ll know what we are going
to do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so, he might go and give information
to the government, and get that reward,&rdquo; announced
Fenn. &ldquo;I wish we&rsquo;d been more careful!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I guess he&rsquo;ll have his own troubles finding
that cliff,&rdquo; was Bart&rsquo;s opinion. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t
mention any special place. Our secret is safe
enough.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After further consideration of what they had
said the boys agreed with this view. As they were
now almost alone in the car they talked freely,
deciding on what to do when in the woods.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
They had brought a small sleeping tent with
them, some guns which they had hired and a limited
supply of food. As they were going to be
within reach of small settlements, villages or, at
the worst, scattered farm houses, they calculated
they could, from time to time, buy what they
needed to eat.</p>

<p>They had made a careful study of a map of the
country they intended to utilize as part of their
vacation trip, and decided on a place to camp that
was not far from where they had observed the
queer actions of the men on the cliff. It was also
within a short distance of Bayville, where, as has
been said, Mr. Hayward and his daughter lived.</p>

<p>They left the train at a station, near the foot
of a small mountain, on the slopes of which they
were to pitch their tent. Their baggage and supplies
was piled up on the platform and, Frank,
surveying it, exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear, I wish we had that mule we used
when we were rescuing my father. He could carry
a good deal of this stuff, and we wouldn&rsquo;t break
our backs.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aw, don&rsquo;t mind a little thing like that!&rdquo; advised
Bart. &ldquo;Why it&rsquo;s not far, and we can make
two trips if necessary.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They decided this would be the best plan, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
taking what they could carry, they set off into the
woods, the station agent agreeing to look after
what baggage they left behind, until they came back
for it.</p>

<p>The weather was fine, and the air, in that northwestern
region, was clear and bracing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I could carry twice as much as this,&rdquo; announced
Ned, as he walked along, balancing his
load on his shoulder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, take mine then!&rdquo; cried Frank quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not to-day,&rdquo; retorted Ned with a laugh. &ldquo;I
was only figuratively speaking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They picked out a good camping place, and, as
they had brought the tent with the first load, they
set that up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now for the rest of the stuff, and we&rsquo;ll be
in good shape for the night,&rdquo; remarked Bart.
&ldquo;Come on, fellows. Why, Fenn, what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo;
he asked quickly, as he noticed the stout
youth seated on a log.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me? Nothing. I&rsquo;m all right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;re not. You&rsquo;re as white as a sheet
of paper,&rdquo; went on Bart. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you feel well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure. I&rsquo;m all right. I guess I walked a
little too fast; that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, take a good rest before you make the
second trip,&rdquo; advised Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ll tell you what we&rsquo;ll do,&rdquo; proposed
Frank. &ldquo;We three can easily carry what stuff
is back there at the depot. Let Fenn stay here
and rest, and we&rsquo;ll go back for it. Besides, we
ought to leave somebody on guard,&rdquo; he added
quickly, fearing Fenn might object to anyone doing
his share of the work.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll be all right in a minute, fellows,&rdquo;
said Fenn, trying to smile, but making rather poor
work of it. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the heat, I guess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is hot,&rdquo; agreed Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You go ahead and I&rsquo;ll catch up to you,&rdquo; proposed
Fenn. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m feeling a little better now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, you stay here and we&rsquo;ll fetch the rest of
the stuff,&rdquo; repeated Frank, and he insisted on it,
with such good reason, also pointing out that if
any tramps came along they might steal the tent,
that Fenn consented to remain on guard. In fact
he was very glad to do so, as he felt a curious
sensation in his head and stomach, and he was not
a little alarmed, as he had never been seriously
ill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope he isn&rsquo;t going to be sick,&rdquo; observed
Bart, as the boys started back to the station.
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll have to give up our camp if he is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;ll be all right,&rdquo; asserted Ned, confidently.
&ldquo;It was only the heat and the walk.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; rejoined Frank.</p>

<p>But when the boys returned with the remainder
of the camp stuff two hours later, they found an
unpleasant surprise awaiting them.</p>

<p>In the tent, stretched out on some hemlock
boughs which they had cut before leaving, they
found poor Fenn. He was very pale and his eyes
were closed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s asleep,&rdquo; whispered Ned.</p>

<p>Frank entered softly and placed his hand on
Fenn&rsquo;s head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s got a high fever,&rdquo; he said, with alarm
in his voice. &ldquo;Fellows, I&rsquo;m afraid Fenn&rsquo;s quite
sick.&rdquo;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX</h2>

<h3>OUT ON A HUNT</h3>


<p>Frank&rsquo;s announcement seemed to strike a cold
chill to the hearts of Ned and Bart. Sickness was
something with which they had seldom come in
contact, and they did not know how to proceed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose we&rsquo;d better get a doctor,&rdquo; ventured
Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; inquired Frank as he came from
the tent. &ldquo;There isn&rsquo;t one within five miles&mdash;maybe
farther.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Haven&rsquo;t we any medicine?&rdquo; asked Bart. &ldquo;I
thought you said you brought some along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I did,&rdquo; replied Frank. &ldquo;Stuff for burns,
cuts and stomach aches, but I don&rsquo;t know as it
would be safe to give him anything when he has
a fever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you got anything for a fever?&rdquo; inquired
Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, some of those little, white tasteless pills,
that come in small bottles. Homeopathic remedies
they call &rsquo;em. I&rsquo;ll read the directions.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
At that instant Fenn murmured something.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s talking!&rdquo; exclaimed Frank, listening at
the flap of the tent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Water, mother. Give me a drink of water,&rdquo;
spoke the sick boy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He thinks he&rsquo;s home,&rdquo; said Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here, I&rsquo;ll get him a drink, and you read the
directions on that bottle of pills,&rdquo; directed Bart.
&ldquo;Maybe we can give him some.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fenn drank thirstily of the spring water Bart
carried in to him, scarcely opening his eyes, and,
when he did, he did not know his chum.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The smugglers!&rdquo; exclaimed the now delirious
youth. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll catch &rsquo;em! Don&rsquo;t let Ruth fall
into the cave. Look out!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys were much frightened, especially Ned
and Bart. Frank, from the experience he had
had with his father, knew a little more than did
the others about cases of illness. He read what
it said on the bottle of pills and decided it would
be safe to give Fenn several of the pellets.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, we&rsquo;d better get the camp in shape for
night,&rdquo; said Frank. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got to stay here until
morning, no matter what happens. We can&rsquo;t
move Fenn until he&rsquo;s better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe he&rsquo;ll not get better,&rdquo; remarked Ned,
rather gloomily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
&ldquo;Oh, cut out such ideas,&rdquo; advised Frank.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll be all right. Probably his stomach is upset.
Now hustle around and get a fire going. I
want some hot coffee, and so do you. Then we&rsquo;ll
all feel better, after a bit of grub.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Once Bart and Ned had something definite to
do they did not worry so much about Fenn. Frank
took a look at him, now and then, in the midst of
the work of making the camp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s asleep,&rdquo; he announced after one inspection.
&ldquo;I think his fever&rsquo;s going down some.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s good,&rdquo; commented Bart, his face losing
some of its worried look.</p>

<p>The boys ate a hasty supper and then made a
more comfortable bed for Fenn. The tent was
big enough for all four to stretch out under it,
but the three chums decided they would take turns
sitting up, in order to administer to the sick lad.</p>

<p>Frank gave him some more medicine during the
night, and, by twelve o&rsquo;clock, Fenn was somewhat
better, though he still had a fever.</p>

<p>It seemed that morning would never come, but,
at length, there shone through the forest a pale,
gray light, that turned to one of rosy hue, and then
the golden sunbeams streamed through the trees.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank goodness the night&rsquo;s gone,&rdquo; exclaimed
Ned, who had the last watch. &ldquo;It seems as if<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
we&rsquo;d been here a week, instead of a few hours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How is he?&rdquo; asked Bart of Frank, who had
assumed the rle of doctor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No worse, at any rate,&rdquo; he said, as he felt of
his chum&rsquo;s head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think we ought to get a physician?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;ll see how he is to-day,&rdquo; answered
Frank. &ldquo;If he doesn&rsquo;t get any worse I believe
it will work off. I&rsquo;ll give him some more medicine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There must have been some virtue in the pills,
for, by noon, Fenn&rsquo;s skin was much cooler, and
he had began to perspire, a sure sign that the fever
was broken. His mind, too, was clear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? What happened?&rdquo; he
asked. &ldquo;Was I sick?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess it was a little touch of sun-stroke,&rdquo; replied
Frank with a laugh. &ldquo;How do you feel?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Pretty good, only weak. I&rsquo;m hungry and
thirsty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a good sign. I guess we can fix you
up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fenn made a fairly good meal on canned chicken
and some biscuits which Ned concocted out of a
package of prepared flour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I can get up now,&rdquo; announced the sick
youth, as he finished the last of his meal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
&ldquo;No you don&rsquo;t!&rdquo; exclaimed Frank. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the
trained nurse in charge to-day, and you stay in the
tent until night, anyhow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fenn wanted to disobey, but he found he was
weaker than he thought, so he was glad to stretch
out on the blanket, spread over the fragrant hemlock
boughs. He was so much better by night
that the boys were practically assured he was out
of danger. They felt correspondingly happy, and
prepared as fine a meal as they could in celebration
of the event.</p>

<p>Fenn ate sparingly, however, and then fell off
into a sound, healthful sleep. His three comrades
took turns during the night watch, but there was
nothing for them to do, save, now and then, to
replenish the camp fire.</p>

<p>The next day Fenn was so much better that he
insisted on getting up, but he did not have much
ambition to do things.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll go hunting, as soon as you are able,&rdquo;
announced Frank, after breakfast. &ldquo;Our pantry
isn&rsquo;t very well stocked.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t wait for me,&rdquo; urged Fenn. &ldquo;Go
ahead. I can stay in camp, and look after things
while you three are gone. I&rsquo;ll take my turn at
hunting a little later.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At first the boys would not hear of this, but,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
after Fenn pointed out that they must have stuff
to eat, they agreed to go hunting the next day,
leaving him alone in camp, if it was found, by
morning, that he was well enough.</p>

<p>Fortunately this proved to be the case and Ned,
Frank and Bart, carrying the guns they had hired
in Duluth, started off, cautioning Fenn to take care
of himself, and not to wander away from the tent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll be back as soon as we have shot something
to eat,&rdquo; promised Bart.</p>

<p>It was rather lonesome in camp for Fenn, after
his chums had left. At first he sat in front of
the tent, watching the antics of some squirrels who,
emboldened by hunger, came quite close to pick up
crumbs. Fenn scorned to shoot at them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m strong enough to take a little
walk,&rdquo; decided the youth, after an hour or so of
idleness. &ldquo;It will do me good. Besides, I want
to get a line on just where that cliff is, on which
we saw the queer men.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He started off, and found he had regained nearly
all his former strength. It was a fine day, and
pleasant to stroll through the woods.</p>

<p>Fenn wandered on, aiming for the lake, which
was some distance away from where the tent was
pitched. Suddenly, as he was going through a
little glade, he heard a noise on the farther side<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
of the clearing, as though some one had stepped
on, and broken, a tree branch. Looking quickly
up he saw, half screened by a clump of bushes,
two Chinamen, and a white man.</p>

<p>The odd trio, whose advance had alarmed Fenn,
stopped short. Then one of the Celestials muttered
some lingo to the other. An instant later
the three drew back in the bushes, and Fenn could
hear them hurrying away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m on the track of the smugglers!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to follow them and see
where they go! I must be nearer the cliff than
I thought.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Off Fenn started, after the three men. If he
had known what lay before him he would have
hesitated a long time before doing what he did.
But Fenn did not know.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI</h2>

<h3>THE CHINESE BUTTON</h3>


<p>Game was not so plentiful in the woods about
the camp, as the three chums had hoped. Frank,
Ned and Bart tramped along, keeping a close
watch for anything that would promise to restock
the larder, but, for some time, the most they saw,
were numbers of small birds&mdash;too small to shoot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why can&rsquo;t we scare up a covey of partridges?&rdquo;
asked Ned, rather disgustedly, after they had been
out an hour or more.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you wish for a herd of deer, or a
drove of bears, that is if bears go in droves,&rdquo;
suggested Bart. &ldquo;You want things too easy, you
do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care whether they&rsquo;re easy or not, as
long as there are some of them,&rdquo; retorted Ned.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to hear how this gun sounds when it&rsquo;s
shot off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hark! What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; exclaimed Bart, looking
up as a sudden whirring noise was audible in
the air over their heads.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
The boys looked up, and, to their surprise, saw
a big flock of wild ducks, flying quite low. It
was rather early in the season for them, as they
learned later, but they did not stop to think of
that. Without further words, they raised their
guns and blazed away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hurrah! We got some!&rdquo; yelled Ned, as he
saw several of the wild fowl tumbling earthward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The other barrel!&rdquo; exclaimed Frank. &ldquo;We
may not get another chance, and we&rsquo;d better kill
enough to last us a week.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They fired again, and killed several more of the
ducks. They found the birds to be in fairly good
condition, though they would be fatter later on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They will make fine eating!&rdquo; remarked Bart,
as he held up a string of the wild fowl. &ldquo;Maybe
Fenn won&rsquo;t like to set his teeth in a nice browned
piece of roast duck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Providing he is well enough to eat it,&rdquo; added
Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;ll be well enough,&rdquo; was Frank&rsquo;s answer.
&ldquo;But I&rsquo;d like to get something else besides
duck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve got plenty of time yet,&rdquo; suggested
Bart. &ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go a little farther.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Slinging their game over their shoulders, and
reloading their guns, the boys once more started<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
off. They had not gone far before a commotion
in a clump of underbrush, just ahead of where
Ned was walking, startled the lad into sudden
activity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s something!&rdquo; he called in a hoarse
whisper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and it&rsquo;s liable to come out and shake
hands with you, and ask how you like the weather,
if you yell that way again,&rdquo; remarked Frank.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know any better than to call out
like that when you&rsquo;re hunting?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t help it,&rdquo; whispered Ned. &ldquo;I saw
something big and black. I think it&rsquo;s a bear.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A bear! Where?&rdquo; cried Bart in a whisper,
cocking his gun.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go easy,&rdquo; advised Frank. &ldquo;We stand a swell
chance of killing a bear with these light shotguns.
Where is it, Ned?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boys were all speaking in low tones, and
had come to a halt in a little circle of trees. All
about them was thick underbrush, from the midst
of which had issued the disturbance that caused
Ned to exclaim.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There it is!&rdquo; he said, grasping Frank by the
arm, and pointing toward something dark. At
that moment it moved, and a good-sized animal
darted forward, right across the trail, in front<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
of the boys, and, an instant later was scrambling
up a tall tree as if for dear life.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; cried Ned, suiting the action to the
word. He aimed point-blank at the creature, but,
when the smoke cleared away, there was no dead
body to testify to his prowess as a hunter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Missed!&rdquo; exclaimed Ned disgustedly. &ldquo;And
it was a fine chance to bowl over a bear cub,
too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bear cub?&rdquo; repeated Frank. &ldquo;Take a look
at what you think is a bear cub.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frank pointed to the tree, up which the animal
had climbed. There, away out on the end of
a rather thin limb, it crouched, looking down on
the boys&mdash;a huddled bunch of fur.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A raccoon!&rdquo; exclaimed Bart. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a fine
naturalist, you are, Ned. Why didn&rsquo;t you take it
for a giraffe or an elephant?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right, you&rsquo;d have made the same
mistake if you had seen it first,&rdquo; retorted Ned.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to have a shot at it, anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He raised his gun, but the raccoon, probably
thinking now was the opportunity to show that he
believed in the old maxim, to the effect that discretion
is the better part of valor, made a sudden
movement and vanished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See!&rdquo; exclaimed Ned triumphantly. &ldquo;He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
knew I was some relation to Davy Crockett. He
didn&rsquo;t exactly want to come down, but he had
some business to attend to in another tree.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s an easy way of getting out of it,&rdquo; remarked
Bart, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ll wager you would have
missed worse than I did if you had shot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, come on and stop scrapping!&rdquo; exclaimed
Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re not scrapping,&rdquo; retorted Ned. &ldquo;Only
I say I&rsquo;m as good a shot as he is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can prove it, by shooting at a mark,
when we get back to camp,&rdquo; suggested Frank.
&ldquo;Just now we&rsquo;re out hunting, not trying to decide
a rifle match.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But word seemed to have gone through the
woods that three mighty boy hunters were abroad,
and all the game appeared to have gone into hiding.
Tramp as the chums did, for several miles,
they got no further sight of anything worth shooting
at.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;ll have to be content with the ducks,
and go back,&rdquo; remarked Frank, after a somewhat
long jaunt in silence. &ldquo;Fenn may be lonesome
waiting for us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know my stomach is lonesome for something
to eat,&rdquo; returned Bart. &ldquo;The sooner some of
these ducks are roasting, or stewing or cooking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
in whatever is the quickest way, the better I&rsquo;ll like
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, let&rsquo;s head for camp,&rdquo; agreed Ned,
and, having picked out their trail, by the help of
a compass they carried, they were soon journeying
toward where their tent was set up.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I hope Fenn is all right,&rdquo; remarked Frank,
as they trudged onward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right? Why shouldn&rsquo;t he be?&rdquo; inquired
Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I was a little worried about leaving him
alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why Fenn is able to take care of himself,&rdquo;
declared Ned. &ldquo;Besides, what&rsquo;s there to be afraid
of?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; admitted Frank. &ldquo;But suppose
another spell of fever should suddenly develop,
and he was all alone? It wouldn&rsquo;t be very
nice.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, he was as anxious to have us go as we
were to start off,&rdquo; remarked Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it, but still, I can&rsquo;t help feeling a little
anxious.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;ll be all right,&rdquo; declared Bart, confidently.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;ll have a good fire ready for us,
coffee made, and all we&rsquo;ll have to do will be to
clean these ducks and put them to roast.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; replied Frank.</p>

<p>The boys, in the excitement of the chase, had
gone farther into the woods than they had anticipated
on starting out. Consequently it was later
than they expected when they got to where they
saw landmarks that told them they were near camp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only about half a mile farther now,&rdquo; remarked
Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give a yell,&rdquo; suggested Ned. &ldquo;Fenn will
hear it and know we are coming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The three chums united their voices in a loud
hallo; and, when the echoes had died away, they
listened for an answering cry. None came, and
the woods were silent, save for the noises made by
birds flitting here and there in the branches of the
trees.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He didn&rsquo;t hear us,&rdquo; said Ned. &ldquo;Try again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe&mdash;maybe he isn&rsquo;t there,&rdquo; suggested
Frank, in a low voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course he is!&rdquo; declared Ned. &ldquo;Maybe
he&rsquo;s asleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess he didn&rsquo;t hear us,&rdquo; suggested Bart.
&ldquo;The wind is blowing the wrong way. Let&rsquo;s yell
again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Once more they shouted, but with no effect.
There came no answering hail.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; called Frank, increasing his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
speed. The boys spoke but seldom during the
remainder of the tramp to camp. When they
came in sight of the tent they strained their eyes
for a sight of their chum. He was nowhere to
be seen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Probably he&rsquo;s inside, lying down,&rdquo; spoke Ned.</p>

<p>It needed but a glance within the canvas shelter,
to show that Fenn was not there. In the gathering
dusk Frank gave a hasty glance about the
locality. The embers of what had been the campfire,
were cold. There was no sign that Fenn had
been there recently, or that he had made any
preparations to receive his chums.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He must have gone off in the woods and forgotten
to come back,&rdquo; suggested Bart. &ldquo;Maybe
he went hunting on his own account.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he had, he&rsquo;d have taken his gun,&rdquo; replied
Frank, pointing to where the weapon stood in a
corner of the tent.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then he&rsquo;s out for a walk,&rdquo; declared Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s staying rather late,&rdquo; commented Frank.
&ldquo;I hope&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frank did not finish his sentence. Suddenly, he
darted forward and picked up something off the
ground.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Bart.</p>

<p>For answer Frank held it out on the palm of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
his hand. It was a small object and the two boys
had to bend close to see what it was. They saw
one of the peculiar brass buttons that serve to hold
the loops with which a Chinese blouse is fastened.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A Chinese button!&rdquo; exclaimed Bart, in a
whisper.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Chinamen have been here!&rdquo; added Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It looks as if the smugglers had Fenn,&rdquo; said
Frank solemnly. &ldquo;They must have sneaked in
here and carried him off!&rdquo;</p>



<hr class="cb" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII</h2>

<h3>FENN&rsquo;S MISHAP</h3>


<p>Fenn had not gone very far, in pursuit of the
two Chinamen and their white companion, before
he became aware that he was not as strong as he
thought he was. In his legs there was strange
trembling, and his head felt dizzy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess I was sicker than I imagined,&rdquo; he
said to himself, as he kept doggedly on. &ldquo;But
I&rsquo;ll trail &rsquo;em. I&rsquo;m going to find out where they
are staying, how they get to the cliff, and what it&rsquo;s
all about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ahead of him Fenn could hear the trio making
their way through the underbrush. They seemed
to be following some trail, as there was a faintly-defined
path through the woods at this point.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They must be preparing to smuggle in a shipload
of Chinese,&rdquo; thought Fenn. &ldquo;Probably it&rsquo;s
the same gang we scared off farther down the
lake. They&rsquo;ve come up here. Oh, if I had some
way of sending word to a government detective,
I could catch &rsquo;em in the very act! But, if I can<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
find out where the landing place is I can show
the officers how to get to it. That is, if they don&rsquo;t
take the alarm and skip out. They must know
me by this time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The trail was becoming more difficult to follow.
It still led toward the lake and Fenn was sure
he was on the right track. Already he had visions
of what he would do with the reward money, after
he had given his chums their shares.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whew! But I&rsquo;m getting tired!&rdquo; exclaimed
the lad, after making his way through a particularly
thick bit of underbrush. &ldquo;I wish some of
the fellows were along to take up the chase. I
wonder if they&rsquo;re going much farther?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He paused a moment to rest, and listened intently
for a sound of the retreating footsteps of
those ahead of him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; he exclaimed, after a second or two.
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t hear them!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were no sounds save those made by the
birds and small beasts of the forest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve distanced me!&rdquo; Fern exclaimed. &ldquo;I
couldn&rsquo;t keep up with them! Now I&rsquo;ve lost track
of them! What shall I do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was trembling, partly from excitement, and
partly from nervousness and weakness. A mist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
seemed to come before his eyes. He looked about
him and saw, off to the left, a little hill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll climb that, and see if I can catch a glimpse
of them,&rdquo; he said, speaking aloud. The sound of
his own voice seemed to bring his confidence back
to him. His legs lost their trembling and he felt
stronger.</p>

<p>Up to the summit of the hill he made his way,
finding it a more toilsome climb than he had
imagined. He reached the top. Below him,
stretched out like a narrow ribbon of gray on a
background of green, was the little trail he had
been following, and which had been taken by the
three men. It wound in and out among the
woods, extending toward the lake, a glimpse of
the shining water of which Fenn could just catch.</p>

<p>Something moving on the trail caught his eye.
He looked intently at it, and, the next moment
he exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;There they are! They&rsquo;re hurrying along as
if a whole band of detectives was after them, instead
of me alone. Now to see if I can&rsquo;t catch
up to them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He gave one more look at the two Celestials
and the white man, who, every moment were nearing
their goal, and then, hurried down the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
side of the hill, to cut across through the woods
at the foot, and so reach the trail.</p>

<p>Fenn had not gone more than a dozen steps
when suddenly, having made a jump over a large
boulder in his path, he came down rather heavily
on the other side, in the midst of a clump of
ferns.</p>

<p>There was a curious sinking of the ground, as
though it had caved in. Fenn felt himself falling,
down, down, down! He threw out his hands,
and tried to grab something. He grasped a bunch
of fern, but this went down with him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Help! Help!&rdquo; he instinctively called, though
he knew no one was within hearing, save, perhaps,
those three strange men, and he did not believe
they would help him if they did hear his calls
for aid.</p>

<p>Fenn was slipping and sliding down some inclined
chute that seemed to lead from the summit
of the hill, into the interior of the earth. It was
so dark he could see absolutely nothing and all
he could feel around him were walls of dirt.</p>

<p>They seemed strangely smooth, and he wondered
how he could slide over them and not feel
bumps from rough stones which must surely be
jutting out here and there from the sides of the
shaft down which he had tumbled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
He put out his hands, endeavoring to find something
to grasp to stay his progress, and then he
discovered the reason for his smooth passage.</p>

<p>The walls of the curious slanting tunnel, in
which he had been made an involuntary prisoner,
were composed of smooth clay. Down them water
was slowly dripping, from some subterranean
spring, making the sides as smooth and slippery
as glass.</p>

<p>Fenn tried in vain to dig his fingers into the
walls, in order to stay his progress, but he only
ran the risk of tearing his nails off, and he soon
desisted. All he could do was to allow himself
to be carried along by the force of gravity, and
the incline of the tunnel was not so great as to
make his progress dangerous.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the stopping part I&rsquo;ve got to worry about,&rdquo;
thought poor Fenn. &ldquo;I wonder what&rsquo;s at the end
of all this?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Suddenly, as he was sliding along, feet foremost,
in the darkness, his outstretched right hand
came in contact with something that caused him
to start in terror. It was a round, thin slimy object,
that seemed stretched out beside him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A snake!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve fallen into
a den of serpents!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He drew his hand quickly away, fear and disgust<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
overpowering him for a moment. Then the
thing seemed to be at his left hand. This time,
in spite of himself, his fingers closed around it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A rope! It&rsquo;s a rope!&rdquo; he cried aloud, as he
vainly tried to catch hold of it and stay his sliding
downward. But the rope slipped from his fingers,
and his journey down the curious shaft was unstayed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This must have been dug by men,&rdquo; thought
Fenn. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll wager the smugglers had something
to do with it. Why, maybe it&rsquo;s one of the ways
they land their men. That&rsquo;s it! I must be sliding
right down into the lake. They use the rope
with which to pull themselves up the slippery
tunnel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This idea seemed feasible to him, and he made
further efforts to grasp the rope, in order that he
might stop and pull himself up, instead of being
carried on into Lake Superior.</p>

<p>For that this was to be his fate he now feared,
since, as near as he could tell, the tunnel sloped
in that direction. But though he occasionally felt
the rope, first on one side of him, and then on the
other, he could not get a sufficient grasp on the
slippery strands, covered as they were with clay,
to check his progress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess I&rsquo;m doomed to go to the bottom,&rdquo; he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
thought. &ldquo;If I only fall into deep water it won&rsquo;t
be so bad. I can swim out. But if I land on
the rocks&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fenn did not like to think about it. In fact
his heart was full of terror at his strange situation,
and only his natural courage kept him from giving
way to despair. But he was filled with a
dogged determination to save himself if he could,
even at the end.</p>

<p>Though it has taken quite a while to describe
Fenn&rsquo;s queer mishap, it did not take him long
to accomplish it. He was slipping along at considerable
speed, being shunted from side to side
as the tunnel widened or narrowed, but, on the
whole, being carried onward and downward in a
fairly straight line.</p>

<p>Suddenly the blackness was illuminated the least
bit by a tiny point of light below and in front of
him. It looked like an opening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s daylight ahead,&rdquo; thought the boy.
&ldquo;That must be where the fresh air comes from,&rdquo;
for he had noticed that the tunnel was not close,
but that a current of air was circulating through
it. Fenn was wrong as to the source of this supply,
as he learned later, but he had little time to
speculate on this matter, for, much sooner than
he expected, he had reached the spot of the light.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
He saw, suddenly looming before him, an opening
that marked the end of the tunnel. The shaft
gave a sharp upward turn and Fenn was shot up
and out, just as are packages that are sent down
those iron chutes from the sidewalk into store basements.</p>

<p>A moment later the boy, covered with mud
from head to foot, found himself on a narrow
ledge on the face of a cliff overlooking Lake Superior.
He lay, partly stunned for a moment,
and blinking at the strong light into which he had
come from the darkness of the shaft.</p>

<p>Below him rolled the great lake, on which he
and his chums had so recently been sailing in the
<i>Modoc</i>. Fenn arose to his feet, and gave a glance
about him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the same place!&rdquo; he murmured. &ldquo;The
same place where we saw the men who so mysteriously
disappeared! I&rsquo;m on the track of their
secret!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked at the ledge on which he stood. It
was long and narrow, and, not far from where he
was, he saw a partly-round opening, that seemed
to be the mouth of another shaft, leading straight
down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, more wonders!&rdquo; exclaimed Fenn, walking
toward it. As he did so, he was startled to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
the head of a man emerge from the second shaft.
The fellow gave one look at Fenn and then, with
a cry of warning to some one below, he disappeared.</p>

<p>Fenn, startled and somewhat alarmed, hesitated.
He was on the brink of an odd discovery.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>

<h3>THE SEARCH</h3>


<p>Following the finding of the Chinese button,
and Frank&rsquo;s conclusion that the smugglers had
carried Fenn off, the three chums, back in camp,
startled by the terror the thought gave them, stood
looking at each other for several seconds. They
did not quite know what to make of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you really think the smugglers have him?&rdquo;
asked Ned, of Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, it certainly looks so. Fenn is gone, and
this button is evidence that some Chinese have been
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But might not Fenn be off in the woods somewhere,
and the Chinese have paid a visit here while
he was away?&rdquo; asked Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course that&rsquo;s possible. But I don&rsquo;t believe
Fenn, sick as he was, would remain away so
long.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t that brass button come from some
other garment than one worn by a Chinaman?&rdquo;
inquired Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
&ldquo;It could, but for the fact that it has some
Chinese characters stamped on the under side,
where the shank is,&rdquo; and Frank showed his chums
the queer marks, probably made by the Celestial
manufacturer. &ldquo;Then, here&rsquo;s another bit of evidence,&rdquo;
and he pointed to the ground.</p>

<p>Ned and Bart looked. There, in the soft earth,
they plainly saw several footprints, made by the
peculiar, thick-soled sharp-pointed shoes the Chinese
wear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;ve been here all right,&rdquo; admitted Bart
in a low voice. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s to be done about it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think we ought to see if we can&rsquo;t find Fenn,&rdquo;
declared Ned. &ldquo;We ought to follow and see
where these Chinese footsteps lead. Maybe Fenn
is held a prisoner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we ought to do,&rdquo; agreed Frank.
&ldquo;However, it is too late to do anything much
now. It will soon be night. I think we&rsquo;d better
get something to eat, sleep as much as we can, and
start off the first thing in the morning. Maybe
we can trail the smugglers by following the Chinese
footprints, and, in that way, we may find&mdash;Fenn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frank hesitated a bit over his chum&rsquo;s name,
and there was a catch in his voice. The other
boys, too, were somewhat affected.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
&ldquo;Oh, we&rsquo;ll find him all right,&rdquo; declared Ned,
confidently, to cover up the little feeling he had
manifested. &ldquo;If those smugglers have him, why&mdash;we&rsquo;ll
take him away from them, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way to talk!&rdquo; exclaimed Frank.
&ldquo;Now let&rsquo;s get some grub. What did we shoot
all these ducks for?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The chums soon had a meal ready, but, it must
be confessed, the ducks did not taste as good as
they expected they would. However, that was
more because of their anxiety over Fenn, than from
any defect in the birds or their cooking.</p>

<p>Morning came at last, after what the three
Darewell boys thought was the longest night they
had ever experienced. They only slept in dozes,
and, every now and again, one of them would
awake and get up, to see if there were any signs
of the missing Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor Stumpy,&rdquo; murmured Ned, on one occasion,
when a crackling in the underbrush had deluded
him into the belief that his chum had returned,
but which disturbance was only caused by
a prowling fox. &ldquo;Poor Fenn! I hope he&rsquo;s in
no danger!&rdquo;</p>

<p>If he could have seen Fenn at that moment he
would have had good reason for expressing that
hope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
&ldquo;Now for the trail!&rdquo; exclaimed Bart when,
after a hasty breakfast, the three boys, shouldering
their guns, were ready to start. &ldquo;Which way,
Frank? You seem to have run across the track
of these smugglers, and it&rsquo;s up to you to follow
it. Lead on.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;ll have no difficulty in following
the trail as far as it goes,&rdquo; remarked Frank.
&ldquo;When a Chinaman goes walking he leave a track
that can&rsquo;t be duplicated by any other person or
animal. Lucky it didn&rsquo;t rain in the night, for
what tracks there are will still be plain. And we
don&rsquo;t have to worry about a crowd walking over
the place where they were. We&rsquo;re not troubled
by many neighbors in these woods.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They started off with Frank in the lead, and
he kept a careful watch for the Chinese footprints.
At first they were easy to follow, as the ground
was soft, and the queer cork-soled shoes had been
indented deeply in the clay. But, after a time,
the marks became so faint that, only here and there
could they be distinguished.</p>

<p>Then it became necessary for Frank to station
one of his chums at the place where the last step
was seen, and prospect around, considerably in
advance, until he picked up the next one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
&ldquo;If we had a hound we wouldn&rsquo;t have all this
trouble,&rdquo; he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, seeing as we haven&rsquo;t, we&rsquo;ll have to be
our own dogs,&rdquo; retorted Ned. &ldquo;I guess we can
manage it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They followed the footprints of the one Chinaman
for a mile or more, and then they came to
an end with an abruptness that was surprising,
particularly as the last one was plainly to be seen
in a patch of soft mud.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, he evidently went up in a balloon,&rdquo; announced
Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It does look so, unless he had a pair of wings
in his pocket,&rdquo; supplemented Ned.</p>

<p>Frank went on ahead, looking with sharp eyes,
for a recurrence of the prints. He went so far
into the woods that Bart called to him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think he jumped that distance?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied Frank. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going
to look&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stopped so suddenly that his chums were
alarmed and ran forward to where he was. They
found him staring at some marks in the earth, and
the marks were those they sought&mdash;the footprints
of the Chinese.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How in the world did he ever get over that
space without touching the ground?&rdquo; inquired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
Ned. &ldquo;He must be a wonder, or else have a
pair of those seven-league-boots I used to read
about in a fairy book, when I was a kid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look there!&rdquo; exclaimed Bart, pointing up to
a tree branch overhead.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Horse hair!&rdquo; exclaimed Ned. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t
know a horse could switch his tail so high.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Horses nothing!&rdquo; retorted Bart. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s
hair from the queue of a Chinaman, or I&rsquo;ll eat my
hat!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what&rsquo;s it doing up in the tree?&rdquo; demanded
Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s how he fooled us,&rdquo; replied Bart. &ldquo;He
thought some one might trail him, and when he
got to a good place, he took to the trees. They
are thick enough here so he could swing himself
along from limb to limb, and, after he covered
twenty-five feet or more, he let himself down. It
was a good Chinese trick, but we got on to it.
His pigtail caught in a branch. I guess it hurt
him some.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, here are his footsteps again, as plain
as ever,&rdquo; said Frank, pointing to where the queer
marks were to be seen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But, say, we&rsquo;ve forgotten one thing,&rdquo; said
Ned suddenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; asked Bart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t looked for Fenn&rsquo;s footprints. All
along we&rsquo;ve been paying attention to only the
marks made by the Chink. Now where does Fenn
come in? This Chinese fellow couldn&rsquo;t carry
him; could he?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not unless the Chink was one of the gigantic
Chinese wrestlers I&rsquo;ve read about,&rdquo; admitted Bart.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so, Ned. We have forgotten all about
Fenn&rsquo;s footprints.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The three boys looked at each other. In their
anxiety at following the trail of the queer marks
they had lost sight of the fact that they wanted a
clue to Fenn, as well as to the smugglers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose we&rsquo;d better go back to camp and
begin all over,&rdquo; suggested Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; decided Frank, after a moment&rsquo;s thought.
&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s try these prints a little longer. Maybe
they&rsquo;ll lead us to some place where we can get on
Fenn&rsquo;s trail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The others agreed to this plan, and, once more,
they took up the search. They had not gone far
before Frank, who was again in the lead, called
out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here we are, fellows! This explains it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ned and Bart hurried forward. They found
that Frank had emerged upon a well-defined trail,
that led at right angles to the one they had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
following. But, stranger than that was what the
trail showed.</p>

<p>There, in plain view, were the footprints of two
Chinese and the unmistakable mark of a white
man&rsquo;s foot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There were two parties of smugglers!&rdquo; exclaimed
Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Either that, or one member of the single party
made a cut through the woods, came to our camp,
and then joined the others right here,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Still, I don&rsquo;t see anything of Fenn,&rdquo; remarked
Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No? What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; demanded Frank
quickly, pointing to footprints, quite some distance
back of the others.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fenn&rsquo;s! I&rsquo;ll be jiggered!&rdquo; cried Bart. &ldquo;I
can tell them by the triangle mark, made with hobnails
that he hammered into the heels of his shoes,
after we decided to come on this trip. He said
that would prevent him slipping around on deck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those are Fenn&rsquo;s footsteps all right&mdash;unless
some one else has his shoes,&rdquo; declared Ned.
&ldquo;Come on! We&rsquo;re on the right trail at last.&rdquo;
And the boys hurried forward, hope once more
strong in their hearts.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>

<h3>FENN IS CAPTURED</h3>


<p>For several seconds after he had observed the
man&rsquo;s head disappear down the hole in the ledge,
Fenn waited. He wanted to see if the fellow had
gone for reinforcements, or had retreated. After
a minute or two Fenn decided that the man was as
much frightened as he himself was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take a look down that hole,&rdquo; he decided.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not in very good shape for visiting company,&rdquo;
he went on, with a look at his clay-covered
clothes, &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t believe those chaps are very
particular. I wonder what I&rsquo;m up against? This
is a queer country, with holes in the ground almost
at every turn, leading to no one knows where.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He advanced toward the shaft, down which the
man had vanished, and, as he reached the edge, he
saw that it contained a ladder.</p>

<p>The ladder was made of tree trunks, with the
branches cut off about a foot from where they
joined on, leaving projections sticking up at a slight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
angle, and making a good hold for the hands and
feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I s&rsquo;pose I&rsquo;m foolish to do this all alone,
and that I had better go back to camp and get the
boys,&rdquo; murmured Fenn, as he prepared to descend.
&ldquo;But, if I do, the smugglers may escape, and I&rsquo;ll
lose the reward. There must be an opening at the
bottom of this shaft that leads right out on the
lake shore. When the boats land the smuggled-in
Chinamen, they are probably taken up this shaft,
then through the one I slid down, and so into the
woods, and from there they are spirited wherever
they want to go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked into the shaft, and listened intently,
but could hear no sound. He was surprised to
see that the opening, leading down to he could only
guess where, was dimly lighted, seemingly in a natural
manner. But his wonder at this ceased when,
having gone down a little way, he noticed that the
walls of the shaft were pierced, in the direction of
the lake, with small openings, through which light
came.</p>

<p>The shaft, he then saw, was either a natural
one, or had been bored, straight down the cliff,
and at no great distance from the perpendicular
face of it. The sides seemed to be of soft rock, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
hard clay, and the tree-trunk ladders were fastened
up against the walls by long wooden stakes, driven
in deeply. There were several tree trunks, one
after another, and from the smoothness of the jutting
prongs it was evident that they were often
used.</p>

<p>Down Fenn climbed, stopping every now and
then to peer through the ventilating and light
holes. He caught glimpses of the great lake, that
lay at the foot of the cliff, toward the bottom of
which he was descending in this strange manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Queer I don&rsquo;t hear or see anything more of
those men I was chasing,&rdquo; mused the boy as he
paused a moment opposite one of the air holes to
get his breath. &ldquo;I wonder what became of the
two Chinese and the white chap? Then there&rsquo;s
that man who stuck his head up out of this hole.
He looked like a miner, for his hat was all covered
with dirt. That reminds me, where&rsquo;s my hat?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Instinctively he looked about him, as though he
would find it hanging on one of the prongs of the
tree-trunk ladder, which might answer as a hat
rack. Then he laughed at himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I remember now,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It flew off when
I fell through that clump of fern into the hole I
thought led to China. Guess I&rsquo;ll have to make
my bow without my hat.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
He glanced below him. It seemed as if he was
at the last of the ventilating openings for, further
down, there were no glimmerings of daylight,
which was fast waning. Then, as he looked, he
caught the flickering of a torch, not far down. It
waved to and fro, casting queer shadows on the
walls of the shaft, and then the person holding it
seemed coming up the ladder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now there&rsquo;s going to be trouble,&rdquo; thought
Fenn. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t pass on this thing. Either
he&rsquo;s got to wait until I get down, or I&rsquo;ll have to
go all the way back to the top. I wonder if I
better yell to let him know I&rsquo;m here? No, that
wouldn&rsquo;t be just the thing. I&rsquo;ll try to slip around
between the wall and the ladder, and, maybe, he&rsquo;ll
pass me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fenn proceeded to put this rather risky plan into
operation. Holding on by both hands to one of
the projecting branches he endeavored to swing
himself around. The man with the torch was
coming nearer and nearer.</p>

<p>Suddenly Fenn&rsquo;s hold slipped. He tried to recover
himself but without avail. The next moment
his hands lost their grip and he went plunging
down into the darkness below, faintly illuminated
by the smoking torch. Then he knew no
more.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
When Fenn came to his senses it was only with
the utmost difficulty that he could recall what had
happened. He had a hazy recollection of having
been in some dark hole&mdash;then a light was seen&mdash;then
he slipped&mdash;then came blackness and then&mdash;</p>

<p>He tried to raise himself from where he lay,
and a rustling told him he was reclining on a bed
of straw. By the light of a torch stuck in the
earthen wall of what seemed to be a cavern, Fenn
could make out the shadows of several men, grotesquely
large and misshapen, moving about. From
the distance came a peculiar noise, as of machinery.</p>

<p>Fenn&rsquo;s brain cleared slowly, though from the
ache in his head, he knew he must have had quite
a fall. He raised himself on his elbow, and gradually
came to a sitting position. He drew a long
breath, and started to get up.</p>

<p>As he did so, he felt some one place his hands on
his chest, and push him back, not rudely, but with
enough firmness to indicate that he was to lie
down. Instinctively he struggled against what
seemed to him a dim shape in the half-darkness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lie down,&rdquo; a man&rsquo;s voice commanded.
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll be all right in a little while. You had
quite a fall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? Where am I? Who
are you?&rdquo; asked Fenn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s all right now, sonny,&rdquo; was the reply
in such soothing tones, as one sometimes uses toward
a fretful child. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re in safe hands.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Has the kid woke up?&rdquo; called a voice from
the blackness beyond the circle of light cast by
the torches.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered the man who had made Fenn
lie down.</p>

<p>Following the words there was a sudden increase
in the illumination of the cavern, and Fenn
saw a big man approaching, carrying a torch.
With him were several others. One of them had
a rope.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you&mdash;are you going to make me a prisoner?&rdquo;
asked Fenn, his heart sinking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Just then another man flashed a torch in the
boy&rsquo;s face. No sooner had he done so than he
called out:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great Scott! If it isn&rsquo;t the very kid I
chased!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fenn glanced quickly up and saw, standing before
him, the man with the sinister face&mdash;the man
who had pursued him at the elevator fire. Beside
him was a man with a peculiar cast in one
eye, and Fenn knew he was the fellow who had
listened to the conversation of the chums in the
railroad car.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV"></a>CHAPTER XXV</h2>

<h3>AN UNEXPECTED MEETING</h3>


<p>Along the trail, which they had thus suddenly
come upon, fairly ran Frank, Ned and Bart. Now
that they were sure Fenn was ahead of them,
though they could not tell how long since he had
passed that way, they were anxious to find their
chum as soon as possible.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It looks as if Fenn was chasing the Chinese
and the white man, instead of them being after
him,&rdquo; suggested Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unless they are leading him with a rope,&rdquo; remarked
Frank. &ldquo;In that case he would be marching
behind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll bet they&rsquo;d have a fine time making
Fenn march along with a rope on him,&rdquo; said Bart.
&ldquo;He&rsquo;d lie down and make &rsquo;em drag him. That
would be Fenn&rsquo;s way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unless he&rsquo;s too sick to make any resistance,&rdquo;
replied Frank, who seemed to take a gloomy view
of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, there&rsquo;s no good wasting time talking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
about it,&rdquo; declared Bart. &ldquo;What we want to do
is to find Fenn. Then we&rsquo;ll know exactly how it
was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right; save our breaths to make speed
with,&rdquo; added Ned.</p>

<p>Though the boys were not lagging on the trail,
they increased their pace until they were going
along at a dog trot, which carried them over a considerable
space in a short time, yet was not too
tiring. They caught occasional glimpses of the
marks left by the feet of the Chinese and the white
man, as well as prints of Fenn&rsquo;s shoes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There they go, up that hill!&rdquo; exclaimed Ned,
who, for the time being, was in the advance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who? The men?&rdquo; called Bart quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, the footprints. Come on,&rdquo; and he led
the way up the little hill, up which Fenn had hurried
the day previous, with such disastrous results.
Fortunately the pace was beginning to tell on Ned,
and, as he reached the summit, and started down
the other side, he slowed up. It was to this circumstance
that he avoided stepping right into the
hole of the shaft, down which Fenn had taken that
queer-sliding journey.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look here!&rdquo; yelled Ned, so excitedly that his
two companions fairly jumped up to gain his side,
thinking he must have come upon either Fenn or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
one of the men. &ldquo;Somebody has fallen down
that hole!&rdquo;</p>

<p>That was very evident, for the fresh earth on the
edges, the scattered and torn clumps of fern, and
the general disturbance about the mouth of the
pit, showed that all too plainly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See!&rdquo; suddenly exclaimed Bart. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s
his hat!&rdquo; and, turning to one side he picked it
up from the ground, where it had fallen when poor
Fenn took his tumble. &ldquo;This shows he was
here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We were sure enough of that before,&rdquo; said
Frank, &ldquo;but it certainly does seem to indicate
that Fenn went down there. I wonder whether he
fell, or whether those men thrust him down?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bart threw himself, face downward, close to
the edge of the hole. He looked carefully at the
marks on the edges. Then he got up and began
looking about in a circle. Finally, he walked back
some distance down the hill.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have it!&rdquo; he finally announced.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, let&rsquo;s have it and see if we agree with
you,&rdquo; spoke Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fenn came up this hill all alone,&rdquo; declared
Bart. &ldquo;If you had looked closely enough you
could see that the footprints of the Chinese and
the white man go around the base of the hill to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
the right. Probably they made a turn, when
Fenn wasn&rsquo;t looking. He thought they went up
the hill. He hurried after them, and stepped
right into this trap. Probably it was covered over
with leaves or grass, and he couldn&rsquo;t see it, until
it was too late. That&rsquo;s my theory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I believe you&rsquo;re right,&rdquo; declared Frank.
&ldquo;It sounds reasonable.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then the next question is; what are we going
to do about it?&rdquo; inquired Ned. &ldquo;No use standing
here discussing what happened, or how it happened.
What we want to do is to get busy and
rescue Fenn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the way to talk,&rdquo; declared Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute,&rdquo; suggested Bart. Once more
he got down close to the hole, and peered into the
depths.</p>

<p>&ldquo;See anything?&rdquo; asked Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There a way to get down,&rdquo; replied Bart, after
a moment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How; a ladder?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No. Ropes. See, there are cables fastened
to the sides of this shaft, and it looks as if they
had been used several times.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Bart reached down and got hold of a clay-covered
rope, one of those which Fenn had tried
so vainly to grasp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s funny,&rdquo; remarked Frank. &ldquo;Looks
as if this was a regular underground railway system.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll bet that&rsquo;s what it is,&rdquo; cried Ned. &ldquo;This
must be one of the means whereby the smugglers
get the Chinamen ashore. Why didn&rsquo;t we think
of it before? Let&rsquo;s go down there. We can easily
do it by holding on to the ropes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too risky,&rdquo; decided Frank. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no
telling what is at the bottom.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But we&rsquo;ve got to save Fenn!&rdquo; exclaimed
Bart, who rather sided with Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know that, but there&rsquo;s no use running recklessly
into danger. We can&rsquo;t help him that way.
If he&rsquo;s down that hole, or in the hands of the
smugglers, we can do him more good by keeping
out of that pit, or away from the scoundrels, than
we can by falling into their hands. Fenn needs
some one outside to help him, not some one in the
same pickle he&rsquo;s in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frank&rsquo;s vigorous reasoning appealed to his
chums, and, though they would have been willing
to brave the unknown dangers of the hole, they
admitted it would be best to try first some other
means of rescuing their chum.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s prospect around a bit,&rdquo; proposed Frank.
&ldquo;Maybe we can find some other way of discovering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
where this hole leads to. The lake can&rsquo;t be
far away, and if we can get down to the shore we
may see something that will give us a clue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right, come on,&rdquo; said Bart, and the Darewell
chums started down the hill, in the direction of
Lake Superior.</p>

<p>As they emerged upon a bluff, which overlooked
the vast body of water, they came to a pause, so
impressed were they, even in their anxiety, with the
beautiful view that stretched out before them.
Under the bright rays of the morning sun the lake
sparkled like a sheet of silver.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish we were all safe together again, aboard
the <i>Modoc</i>,&rdquo; remarked Ned, after a moment&rsquo;s
pause.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Same here,&rdquo; echoed Bart. &ldquo;But, if we&rsquo;re&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was interrupted by a sound off to the left.
Gazing in that direction the boys saw, coming
along the trail toward them, a man and girl.
Something about them seemed familiar.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Hayward!&rdquo; cried Ned.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And his daughter!&rdquo; added Frank, in a lower
voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well! Well!&rdquo; exclaimed the man, whose
lucky escape from the automobile accident in Darewell,
had led to the boys&rsquo; acquaintance with him.
&ldquo;If here aren&rsquo;t my young friends, the Darewell<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
Chums, come to pay me a visit! I&rsquo;m very glad
to see you, but I thought there were four of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So there are, father,&rdquo; interrupted Ruth.
&ldquo;Where is Fenn?&rdquo; she asked, turning quickly to
the three boys. &ldquo;Is he ill&mdash;didn&rsquo;t he come with
you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s lost!&rdquo; replied Frank. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re hunting
for him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lost?&rdquo; repeated Mr. Hayward. &ldquo;How?
Where?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Frank briefly related what had happened since
they had started from Darewell on the cruise to
Duluth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well I never!&rdquo; exclaimed Robert Hayward.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a great story! And the last trace you
have of him is down that hole?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The very last,&rdquo; answered Ned, looking at
Ruth, and not blaming Fenn for thinking she was
pretty.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This must be looked into,&rdquo; declared Mr. Hayward.
&ldquo;Lucky I happened to be out here with
my daughter. You see I live several miles from
here, but to-day, Ruth and I decided to take a
little trip. I&mdash;I wanted to look at some land I&mdash;some
property I am interested in out here. I
was on my way to it when I saw you boys.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The man seemed to have a curious hesitation in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
his manner and his words, and Ruth, too, appeared
under some strain. But the boys were too anxious
about their comrade to pay much attention to this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; suddenly called Mr. Hayward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are you going, father?&rdquo; asked Ruth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to find Fenn Masterson. I think I
have a clue that will help us,&rdquo; and he strode forward,
followed by his daughter and the wondering
boys.</p>

<h3>FENN&rsquo;S ODD DISCOVERY</h3>


<p>Mutual surprise showed on the face of Fenn,
as well as on the countenance of the man who made
this surprising announcement in the cave, where
we have left that rather unfortunate youth. The
boy, who had been prepared to meet a band of
Chinese smugglers, now saw before him the mysterious
person, who appeared to have some interest
in the affairs of Mr. Hayward, and who
seemed to be pleased that misfortune should overtake
the man who had recovered from the auto
accident near Fenn&rsquo;s house.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, how&rsquo;d you get here?&rdquo; asked the man
gruffly, advancing closer to the captive, and holding
his torch to throw the light on Fenn&rsquo;s face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Slid part way, and climbed the rest,&rdquo; answered
the lad, who decided to remain as cool as possible
under the circumstances.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humph! Well, I reckon you know where
you are now?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the least idea, except that I&rsquo;m under
ground.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, and you&rsquo;re liable to stay here for some
time. You&rsquo;ll find, before I get through with you,
that it isn&rsquo;t healthy, out in this country, to pay too
much attention to the business of other folks. I&rsquo;ll
pay you back for spying on me. I thought I&rsquo;d
gotten rid of you some time ago, but I see you&rsquo;re
still after me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not after you,&rdquo; answered Fenn. &ldquo;I
didn&rsquo;t expect to see you down here. Nor am I
spying on you. You&rsquo;re mistaken.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Weren&rsquo;t you trying to hear what I was saying&mdash;the
night of the fire&mdash;aren&rsquo;t you in the
employ of Robert Hayward?&rdquo; demanded the
man, asking his questions too quickly to permit of
any answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not employed by Mr. Hayward, though I
know him, and he is a friend of mine,&rdquo; declared
Fenn. &ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t intentionally listening to what
you were saying that night, but, when I found you
were an enemy of Mr. Hayward, I wanted to
know more about you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you know I am his enemy?&rdquo; asked
the man.</p>

<p>&ldquo;From the way you talked. Besides, why did<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
you chase after me, and try to catch us on the <i>Modoc</i>?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s something for me to know, and for
you to find out,&rdquo; replied the man, with an unpleasant
laugh. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re too wise, you are.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe I&rsquo;ll find out more than you want me
to,&rdquo; retorted Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No danger. I&rsquo;m going to put you where you
can&rsquo;t do anything for a while, and, after you&rsquo;ve
cooled down a bit, I&rsquo;ll think of what to do next.
Tom, come here,&rdquo; he called.</p>

<p>A big man approached, and, at a nod from the
fellow of the sinister countenance, gathered Fenn
up in his arms, in spite of the resistance the lad
made. Fenn soon found it was useless to struggle,
so he remained quietly in the grip of the burly
chap.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Take him to the inner cave,&rdquo; directed the man,
whom the others addressed as Dirkfell, &ldquo;and then
come back. We need you in getting this last load
out. After that we&rsquo;ll take a rest.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fenn tried to see where he was being carried,
but it was almost impossible in the darkness.
There were several flickering torches, stuck in the
earthen walls of the cavern, here and there, and,
by the glimmers of them, the youth could see men
hurrying to and fro. Some carried picks and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
others shovels, while some bore boxes that seemed
to be very heavy.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder what sort of a place I&rsquo;ve gotten into,&rdquo;
thought Fenn. &ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s&mdash;yes, I&rsquo;ll bet
that&rsquo;s what it is&mdash;a gold mine!&rdquo;</p>

<p>For a moment the thought of this made his
heart beat strangely fast. Then cooler reason
came to him, and he recalled that the region around
Lake Superior contained no gold, though there
were mines of other minerals, some quite valuable.</p>

<p>This train of thought was interrupted by the sudden
stopping of the man who was carrying him,
as though he was a baby. The fellow stooped
down, kicked a door open with his foot, and, the
next moment Fenn found himself in a small cave,
lighted by a lantern hanging over a rough table,
around which several chairs were drawn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here&rsquo;s where you stay until the boss tells you
to come out,&rdquo; fairly growled the man.</p>

<p>Fenn did not reply, and the fellow withdrew,
taking care, as the lad noted, to lock the door after
him. No sooner was the portal closed, than Fenn
began an inspection of the place. He took the
lantern and held it close to the door. It was
made of heavy planks, and the fastening seemed
to be on the outside. As for the remainder of the
cave, the walls were composed of hard clay, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
harder rock. The place was a sort of niche, hollowed
out from the larger cavern.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I seem to be in a pickle,&rdquo; observed
Fenn grimly. &ldquo;That comes of prying too much
into other people&rsquo;s affairs, I s&rsquo;pose. No help for
it, however. I&rsquo;m here and the next question is how
to get away. I wish the boys were with me&mdash;no,
I don&rsquo;t either. It&rsquo;s bad enough to be here myself,
without getting them into trouble.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess they&rsquo;ll be surprised when they get back
to camp and find me gone. I wish I&rsquo;d left some
sort of a message. They won&rsquo;t know where to
look for me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Fenn did not give his chums credit for their
energy. The prisoner made a circuit of his dungeon,
and concluded there was no way, at present,
of getting out. He readily got rid of the rope
that fastened his arms behind him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I will just take another look at that door,&rdquo;
mused Fenn, when, having completed his tour of
inspection, which did not take him long, he again
found himself in front of the portal. He held
the lantern up as high as he could. &ldquo;If I stood
on a chair I could see better,&rdquo; he reasoned. He
got one of the rough pieces of furniture, mounted
it, and, was just raising the light up to the top of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
the door when his hand slipped and the lantern fell,
smashing the glass, and extinguishing the wick.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hu!&rdquo; exclaimed Fenn, standing on the
chair in the darkness. &ldquo;Lucky it didn&rsquo;t explode
and set fire to the oil. I&rsquo;d been worse off then I
am now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was in total darkness, and was about to get
down off the chair, and grope his way back to the
table, when a gleam of light, showing through a
crack in the door, attracted his attention.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Somebody is coming,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Maybe
they&rsquo;re going to let me out. Or, perhaps, they
heard the lantern fall.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But, as he looked, he saw that the gleam was
not made by a torch or lantern being carried by
someone approaching his dungeon. Instead it
came from several torches stuck in the wall of the
main cave.</p>

<p>And, by the light of these torches Fenn made an
odd discovery. Several men were digging in the
sides of the cavern, loosening the clay and soft
rock with picks and shovels. They were piling
the material in boxes which were loaded into a
car, that ran on a small track, and were hurried off,
to some place that the boy could not see.</p>

<p>As he watched he saw Dirkfell approach, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
by signs and gestures, for Fenn could not hear at
that distance, the man urged the laborers to work
faster.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re mining,&rdquo; thought Fenn. &ldquo;It must
be valuable stuff, too, or they wouldn&rsquo;t take out
such small quantities. And they must be working
in secret, or they wouldn&rsquo;t take all the precautions
they do, to remain hidden. There&rsquo;s something
queer back of all this, and I&rsquo;d like to see what it
is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fenn applied his eye closely to the crack in
the door. He could see the men gathered about a
cavity in the cavern wall, on which they were working,
and, from the way in which they pointed at
something the boy believed they must have come
upon a rich deposit of whatever ore they were
mining.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wish I was out of this place!&rdquo; exclaimed
Fenn to himself. &ldquo;If I had the boys here to help
me I&rsquo;ll bet we could escape, and then there&rsquo;d be a
different story to tell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There must be an opening, somewhere,&rdquo; he
reasoned. &ldquo;That air comes from under the door.
It&rsquo;s fresh, so there must be some communication
directly with the outer air, from the big cave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stretched out flat on his face, and put his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
eyes as close as he could to the bottom of the portal.
He saw light beneath it, and, jumping up,
exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it! I see a way to get out. But I
must wait until the men have gone!&rdquo;</p>

<p>An idea had come to Fenn. The floor of the
small cave he was in, was of earth. Between it
and the bottom of the door, was quite a space. If
he could enlarge this space, it might be possible for
him to crawl under the door, and this he resolved
to attempt, as soon as it would be safe.</p>

<p>He felt in his pocket to see if his knife was
there, and his heart beat more rapidly as his fingers
closed on the handle. It contained a large,
strong blade, and he thought he could do his digging
with it. But it would be necessary to wait
until the men got out of the way, and, if they
worked in two shifts, this would not occur.</p>

<p>Anxiously Fenn waited. Every minute seemed
an hour as he sat there in the darkness, now and
then kneeling down to peer under the door, to see
if the men had gone. But, every time, he saw
them at their queer operations, or taking something
from the walls of the cave.</p>

<p>He fell into a doze, to be awakened by the entrance
of some one into his apartment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the light?&rdquo; asked a voice Fenn recognized
as belonging to the man who had carried
him in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It fell and broke,&rdquo; he answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Humph! Well, I&rsquo;ll bring another. The
boss didn&rsquo;t give no orders to leave you in the dark.
Here&rsquo;s some grub. It&rsquo;s supper time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What day is it?&rdquo; asked Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thursday. Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The boy did not answer. He knew, however,
that he had been in the cave a much shorter time
than he supposed. It was the evening of the same
day he had started to follow the smugglers. Now
he appeared to have lost track of them, but he was
in the power of a gang as bad, if not worse.</p>

<p>The man brought another lantern, and also some
water. The food was coarse, but Fenn ate it with
a good deal of relish.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Guess you&rsquo;ll have to sleep on the table,&rdquo; the
man went on, as he threw some blankets down.
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no bed in this hotel,&rdquo; and he laughed.</p>

<p>But Fenn was too busy thinking of his plan to
escape, to care about a bed. He hoped, now that
it was night, the men would stop working. And,
in this, he was not disappointed. Some one called
a signal through the cavern, and the men, dropping
their tools, and taking their torches with them, filed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
out of sight of the boy, watching from beneath
the door.</p>

<p>He wanted to begin his digging at once, but
concluded it would be safer to postpone it a while.
He was sure it must have been several hours that
he waited there in the silence. Then, taking an
observation, and finding the outer cavern to be in
blackness, he commenced to burrow under the door,
like a dog after a hidden rabbit.</p>

<p>The big blade of his knife easily cut into the soft
clay, and, working hard for some time, he had quite
an opening beneath the portal. He tried to
squeeze through, but found he was a bit too big
for it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A little more and I can slip out,&rdquo; he whispered
to himself.</p>

<p>Faster and faster he plied the knife, loosening
the earth, and throwing it back with his hands.
Once more he tried and, though it was a tight
squeeze, he managed to wiggle out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now!&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;If I don&rsquo;t run into anybody
I can get to the foot of the shaft, and go up
that ladder. Guess I&rsquo;ll take the light.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He reached back under the door, and got hold
of the lantern, which he had placed near the hole,
slipping it under his coat so that the gleams would
not betray him. Then, remembering, as best he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
could which way the man had carried him, he stole
softly along, on the alert for any of the miners.</p>

<p>He had not gone more than a dozen feet, and
had just turned a corner, which showed him a
straight, long tunnel, that, he believed, led to the
foot of the shaft, when, to his consternation, he
heard a noise. At the same time a voice called:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey! Where you goin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Fenn resolved to chance all to boldness. Taking
the lantern from under his coat, that he might
see to run through the cave, he sprang forward,
toward what he believed was the shaft down which
he had come on the tree-trunk ladder.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop! Stop!&rdquo; called someone behind him,
but Fenn kept on.</p>



<hr class="cb" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII"></a>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>

<h3>A TIMELY RESCUE</h3>


<p>Fenn&rsquo;s fear, and his fierce desire to escape from
the cave, lent him speed. Forward he went, faster
than he had ever run before. Suddenly there
loomed up before him a dim, hazy light, but it
was the illumination from the sun, and not from an
artificial source.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must be morning!&rdquo; the boy thought. &ldquo;I
worked at that hole all night. But how is it that
the sun shines down the shaft? I didn&rsquo;t believe
it could. There&rsquo;s something strange here!&rdquo;</p>

<p>All these thoughts flashed through his mind
while he ran on, intent on distancing his pursuer,
who was close behind him. Fenn could hear the
man&rsquo;s footsteps. Once more the fellow shouted:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hey! Stop! You don&rsquo;t know where you&rsquo;re
goin&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t, eh?&rdquo; thought Fenn. &ldquo;Well, I guess
I do. I&rsquo;m going to get away from you, that&rsquo;s
where I&rsquo;m going.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The dim light became plainer now. Fenn could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
see that it came through an opening in the cave; an
opening that was close to the ground. Clearly
then, this could not be the shaft down which he had
come. He was puzzled, but he kept on.</p>

<p>He threw away the lantern, for he did not need
it any longer to see where to go. Several other
voices joined in the shouts of alarm, and in urging
Fenn to stop. He did not answer but kept on.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I can once get outside they&rsquo;ll not dare to
carry me back,&rdquo; the lad reasoned. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s only a
little farther now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was panting from the run, for the exertion,
following his illness, and the experience he had
gone through, was too much for him. He felt
that he could go no farther. Yet he knew if he
halted now the men would get him, and he feared
for the consequences that might follow his attempt
to escape.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, if only some of the boys were here!&rdquo; was
his almost despairing thought. &ldquo;If ever I needed
help I do now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The light was so good now that Fenn could distinguish
the sides of the cave. He saw that he
was running along a straight tunnel, quite high
and wide, but which narrowed, like a funnel, as it
approached the opening toward which he was
speeding.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
&ldquo;I wonder if there&rsquo;s room for me to get out?&rdquo;
he thought. &ldquo;And I wonder where I&rsquo;ll be when
I get out?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hold on! Hold on!&rdquo; yelled the man back of
Fenn. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll get hurt if you go any farther!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll get hurt if I go back,&rdquo; whispered
Fenn, pantingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop! Stop!&rdquo; cried another voice which the
lad recognized as Dirkfell&rsquo;s. &ldquo;Come back! I&rsquo;ll
not harm you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s too late with that promise,&rdquo; Fenn
thought.</p>

<p>A few seconds later he was at the opening of
the cave. He fairly sprang through it, finding it
large enough to give him passage standing upright.
He leaped out, so glad was he to leave
behind the terrors of the dark cave, and the mysterious
men, who seemed so anxious to keep him a
prisoner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Free!&rdquo; Fenn almost shouted as he passed the
edge of the opening. He was about to give an
exultant cry, but it was choked on his lips.</p>

<p>For the opening was on the sheer edge of a cliff,
without the semblance of a foothold beyond it,
and below it there sparkled the blue waters of
Lake Superior!</p>

<p>Fenn felt himself falling. He was launched<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
through the air by his leap for liberty, and, a moment
later, the lake had closed over his head!</p>

<p>Meanwhile Mr. Hayward, followed by his
daughter, Frank, Bart and Ned was hurrying
along, bent on discovering and rescuing Fenn.
True, they did not know where he was, but Mr.
Hayward had a clue he wished to follow. As he
hastened along, he told the boys what it was.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My daughter and I have been sort of living
in the woods for the past week,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We
have taken auto trips as far as the machine would
go, and then have tramped the rest of the way. I
want to see how my land is. It is some property
I bought a good while ago, and which I never
thought amounted to much. But I have a chance
to sell it now, and I may dispose of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was looking along the lake shore, the other
day, for some of my land extends out there,&mdash;and
I saw a boat, containing some Chinese and a
white man. It was being rowed up and down the
shore, and I thought, at the time, the men acted
rather suspiciously. They seemed to be waiting
for something to happen. I was too busy to pay
much attention to them, but I believe now that they
were part of that smugglers&rsquo; band you speak of.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you tell the police, father?&rdquo;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
asked Ruth. &ldquo;To think of poor Fenn being captured
by them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are not sure he is captured by them, Ruth,&rdquo;
said Mr. Hayward. &ldquo;At any rate I&rsquo;m going to
the point on shore near where I saw the boat. It
may be there is a tunnel running from that place
on the hill, where Fenn disappeared, right down
to the lake. In that case we may find some trace
of him there. This region used to be worked by
some ancient race, I understand, who dug deep into
the earth after certain minerals and ores. There
are several tunnels, shafts and queer passages
through the hills and along shore, I have heard;
shafts that used to give access to the mines. They
have long been abandoned, but it is just possible
that the smugglers may have discovered and utilized
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe they&rsquo;re hiding in a cave, somewhere,
now,&rdquo; suggested Ned, &ldquo;and perhaps they have
Fenn a prisoner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh dear! Isn&rsquo;t it dreadful!&rdquo; exclaimed
Ruth, with a shudder. The other boys could not
help wishing she was as anxious about them as she
was over Fenn. It made up, in a great measure,
for all he was likely to suffer, Bart thought. He
looked closely at Ruth. She seemed strangely excited,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
as though she feared some nameless terror.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This way!&rdquo; called Mr. Hayward, leading
the little party of rescuers through a short cut, and
down a sloping bank to the shore of the lake.
&ldquo;Here we are. Now the boat, when I saw it, was
right opposite that little point of land,&rdquo; and he
motioned to indicate where he meant.</p>

<p>At that instant Bart saw something black bobbing
about on the surface of the lake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; he cried, pointing to it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A boat!&rdquo; exclaimed Ruth. &ldquo;There is the
boat now, daddy!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too small for a boat,&rdquo; replied Mr. Hayward.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a man! It&rsquo;s some one in the lake!&rdquo;
he added excitedly. &ldquo;And he&rsquo;s about done for,
too! I&rsquo;ll swim out and get him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before any of the boys could offer, or indeed
make any move, to go to the rescue, Mr. Hayward
had thrown off the heaviest of his clothing
and plunged in. With powerful strokes he made
for the black object, which, as the others could
see, was a person making feeble efforts to swim
ashore.</p>

<p>With anxious eyes the three chums and Ruth
watched the rescue. They saw Mr. Hayward
reach the bobbing head, saw him place an arm<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
about the exhausted swimmer, and then strike out
for shore.</p>

<p>A few minutes later the man was able to wade.
In his arms he carried an almost inert bundle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I got him, boys!&rdquo; he called.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; asked Ruth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Fenn Masterson! I was just in the nick of
time. He was going down for the final plunge,&rdquo;
and with that he laid the nearly-unconscious form
of Fenn down on the sandy shore.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>

<h3>RUTH TELLS HER SECRET</h3>


<p>&ldquo;Quick! We must hurry him to a doctor!&rdquo;
exclaimed Ruth, as she bent down over Fenn.
&ldquo;Will he die, daddy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think not. He&rsquo;ll be all right in a little
while. But we&rsquo;ll take him to our house. Lucky
the auto is not far away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m&mdash;I&rsquo;m all right,&rdquo; gasped Fenn, faintly.
&ldquo;I was just tired out, that&rsquo;s all. I didn&rsquo;t swallow
any water. There&mdash;there seemed to be some
sort of a current setting against the shore, and&mdash;I
couldn&rsquo;t make any headway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He sat up, looking rather woe-begone, soaking
wet as he was, and with some of the red clay still
clinging to his clothes. Mr. Hayward was hastily
donning his outer garments over his wet things.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll have the auto around in a jiffy!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;Lucky it&rsquo;s summer, and you&rsquo;ll not take
cold. Just rest yourself, Fenn, until I come back,
and we&rsquo;ll have you all right again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But how in the world did you ever get into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
the lake?&rdquo; asked Ruth, as her father hurried
away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I jumped in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jumped in!&rdquo; repeated Bart. &ldquo;How was
that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now we mustn&rsquo;t ask him too many questions,&rdquo;
interrupted Ruth. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s not able to answer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh yes I am,&rdquo; replied the lad who had been
through rather strenuous times in the last few
hours. Thereupon he briefly related what had
happened since his chums left him to go hunting,
ending up with his unexpected plunge into the lake.
In turn Bart told how they had searched for him,
and how, having met Mr. Hayward and his daughter,
the hunt was brought to such a timely ending.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what were those men taking out of the
cave?&rdquo; asked Frank, when Ruth had gone down
the shore, along which a road ran, to see if her
father was returning.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;ve got to discover,&rdquo; answered
Fenn. &ldquo;I think there&rsquo;s a valuable secret back of
it. We&rsquo;ll go&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>But further conversation was interrupted by the
arrival of the auto&mdash;the same big touring car that
had so nearly come to grief in Darewell. The
four boys got in, Fenn was wrapped in a lap robe,
to prevent getting chilled on the quick ride that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
was to follow, and the car was sent whizzing along
an unfrequented road to Mr. Hayward&rsquo;s home,
several miles away.</p>

<p>The three chums wanted to ask Fenn all sorts
of questions about his experiences, but Ruth, who
constituted herself a sort of emergency nurse, forbade
them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have time enough after he has had a
rest,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Besides, he&rsquo;s just gotten over a
fever, you say. Do you want him to get another?
It looks as though he was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>And that was just what happened. When the
auto reached Mr. Hayward&rsquo;s home Fenn was
found to be in considerable distress. His cheeks
were hot and flushed and he was put to bed at
once, though he insisted, with his usual disregard
of trifles that concerned himself, that he was &ldquo;all
right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A physician was summoned, and prescribed
quiet, and some soothing medicine.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He has had a severe shock,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and
this, on top of his former attack of fever, from
which he had barely recovered, has caused a slight
relapse. It is nothing dangerous, and, with careful
nursing he will be all right in a few days.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then, I&rsquo;m going to take care of him,&rdquo; declared
Ruth. &ldquo;It will be a chance to pay back<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
some of his, and his folks&rsquo; kindness to me and my
father. Now mind, I don&rsquo;t want you boys to
speak to Fenn unless I give you permission,&rdquo; and
she laughed as she shook her finger at the chums
to impress this on them.</p>

<p>Fenn, under the influence of the medicine, soon
fell into a deep sleep, which, the pretty nurse said,
was the best thing in the world for him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;d better go back to camp,&rdquo; proposed
Bart. &ldquo;All we brought away from there
are the guns, and some one might come along and
steal the other stuff, which isn&rsquo;t ours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so, those smugglers are still around I
suppose,&rdquo; added Ned. &ldquo;We had better get back,
I think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll do nothing of the sort,&rdquo; declared Mr.
Hayward good-naturedly. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to be
my guests, or I&rsquo;ll be very much offended. We&rsquo;ve
not got such a fine place as some, but you&rsquo;re welcome
to what there is. If things were different&mdash;but
there, I want you to stay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He seemed affected by something, and his manner
was so queer that the boys could not help noticing
it. Ruth, too, appeared embarrassed, and, at
first, Bart and his chums thought it might be that
she was not prepared for company, since, as her
mother was dead, she had the whole care of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
house, though there was a servant to help her.
But her invitation, which she added to that of her
father&rsquo;s, assured the boys that they would be very
welcome.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t rough it so much as you could out
in the woods,&rdquo; said Ruth, &ldquo;but I think you&rsquo;ll like
it here. We have a motor boat, and you may wish
to run it on the lake.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A motor boat!&rdquo; exclaimed Bart. &ldquo;That settles
it! We stay!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what about our camp stuff?&rdquo; asked Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll send a man to gather it up and ship it back
to Duluth,&rdquo; said Mr. Hayward. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no
need of you going back there at all. I&rsquo;ll be glad
to have you stay. We&rsquo;re a little upset on account
of&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stopped suddenly, and glanced at his daughter,
who did not appear to be listening to what he
was saying. But she heard, nevertheless, as was
shown by her next remark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dad means some of the servants have
gone,&rdquo; quickly explained Ruth. &ldquo;You see we
had too many,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;I decided we could
get along with one, for I want to help do the work.
I must learn to be a housekeeper, you know,&rdquo; and
she blushed a little. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re not upset a bit,
daddy. You see, I&rsquo;ll manage.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
It seemed as though something sad was worrying
Mr. Hayward, but, he soon recovered his usual
spirits, and got the boys to give him directions
for shipping back their camp stuff.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, I&rsquo;ll look after it,&rdquo; he said, as he prepared
to leave the house, having changed his wet
garments for dry ones. &ldquo;I have some other matters
to attend to, and I may not be back until late.
I guess you can get along here. You can pretend
you&rsquo;re camping out, and, if you get tired of that,
Ruth will show you where the motor boat is.
Only, don&rsquo;t upset,&rdquo; and, with that caution, he left
them.</p>

<p>The three chums decided they would try the boat
at once, and, Ruth, having ascertained that they
knew how to run one, showed them where the
launch was kept in a neat boat-house on the shore
of Lake Superior.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be gone too long,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You
can&rsquo;t tell what will happen to Fenn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess he couldn&rsquo;t be in better hands,&rdquo; said
Frank, with a bow.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, thank you!&rdquo; exclaimed Ruth, with a
pretty blush.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;ll do you,&rdquo; observed Bart, nudging Frank
with his elbow. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell Fenn when he gets
well.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
Ruth returned to her patient, after urging the
three chums to be back in time for dinner. She
found Fenn awake, and with unnaturally bright
eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You must go to sleep,&rdquo; she told him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t sleep.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m thinking of something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What about?&rdquo; she asked with a little laugh.
&ldquo;About all the wonderful adventures you had?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Partly, and about that cave. It&rsquo;s the same
one.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The same one? What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;The same one you talked about when you were
at our house. The mysterious cave, where the
men were at work. I see it all now. It&rsquo;s the
same cave! There is some secret about it! Tell
me what it is. Don&rsquo;t you remember what you
said? You wanted to find the cave, but couldn&rsquo;t.
I have found it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; exclaimed Ruth. She drew back as
if frightened. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she cried again. &ldquo;Can
it be possible. It seems like a dream! Can it
be my cave?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me about it,&rdquo; suggested Fenn, for even
his illness could not deter him from trying to solve
the mystery.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
&ldquo;I am going to tell you a secret,&rdquo; answered
Ruth. &ldquo;It is something I have told no one. You
know my father is&mdash;or, rather he was&mdash;quite
wealthy. He owned considerable property, and
was counted a millionaire. But lately, through
some misfortune, he has lost nearly all his wealth.
I suspect, though I do not know for sure, that
some wicked men have cheated him out of it. But
he does not know that I am aware of his loss. He
has kept it a secret and he tries to keep up when
he is with me, but I can see the strain he is under.
He does not want me to suffer, dear daddy! But
I don&rsquo;t mind. I don&rsquo;t care for money as long as
I have him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He thinks he can get his wealth back again,
and so he has been making all sorts of sacrifices
in order that I may continue to live here, in the
same style we used to. But I found out about it.
I discharged all the servants but one, to save
money, and I am economizing in other ways.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But about the cave,&rdquo; insisted Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It sounds almost like a dream,&rdquo; went on Ruth.
&ldquo;One day, when I was walking through the woods
around here, just before daddy and I took that
automobile trip East, I was on a ledge of the cliff,
about opposite where you were in the lake to-day.
That particular ledge is not there now, as a landslide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
carried it away, but it was quite large, and
easy to get to, when I was on it. I was after some
peculiar flowers that grew there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;As I was gathering them I saw an opening in
the cliff, and I could look right into a large cave.
I was so surprised I did not know what to do, and,
much more so, when I saw several men at work.
They seemed to be taking stuff out&mdash;valuable
stuff, for they were very careful with it. I must
have made some noise, for one of the men came
to where I was looking in.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was very angry, and tried to grab me. I
drew back, and nearly toppled off the ledge into
the lake. Then the man threatened me. He said
if I ever told what I saw something dreadful would
happen to me.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was much frightened, and hurried away. I
was going to tell my father of what I had seen,
but the memory of the man&rsquo;s threat prevented me.
The thing got on my mind so I was taken ill.
Then came the automobile trip and the accident.
But I could not forget the cave. It seemed like a
bad dream, and it followed me. I did not know
I had mentioned it in my delirium at your house,
until you told me. Then I was frightened lest
something happen to you, as well as to myself, and
I begged you never to refer to it. But I could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
forget it. All the while I kept wondering who
those men were, and what they were taking out. I
thought perhaps they might have found gold. Of
course it was foolish, and, sometimes I think it
was all only a bad dream. Only it is not a dream
about poor daddy losing all his money.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And it isn&rsquo;t any dream about that cave!&rdquo; exclaimed
Fenn, sitting up in bed. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s real.
There are men in it taking out something I think
is valuable. They are doing it secretly, too. I
don&rsquo;t know who it belongs to, but we&rsquo;ll soon find
that out. By some curious chance I have discovered
the same cave you looked into. I&rsquo;ll take
you to it, and we&rsquo;ll see what those men are digging
out. I&rsquo;m going to get right up and go
back there. I&rsquo;m all right! We must go before
the men take all the stuff! Where are the boys?
Tell them to come here and help me dress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, no!&rdquo; exclaimed Ruth. &ldquo;The doctor
said you must be kept quiet!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to go back to that cave!&rdquo; declared
Fenn, and, getting out of bed, clad in a big bath
robe, he began to hunt for his clothes, which, however
were not in the room, having been taken to
the laundry to be pressed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mary! Mary!&rdquo; called Ruth to the servant.
&ldquo;Telephone for the doctor. Tell him Fenn is
delirious!&rdquo;</p>



<hr class="cb" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX"></a>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>

<h3>A BAFFLING SEARCH</h3>


<p>Fenn sat down rather suddenly on hearing Ruth
make that announcement. He grew calm.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said, good-naturedly, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
no use alarming you. I&rsquo;m not delirious. I never
felt better in my life. That sleep I had was fine.
My fever is all gone. But, go ahead, if you want
to. Send for the doctor. I don&rsquo;t mind. I know
what he&rsquo;ll say, and then I can go and hunt for that
cave.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Fenn, are you sure you&rsquo;re all right?&rdquo;
asked Ruth, much reassured by the cool manner
in which the boy spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure. Here, feel of my pulse. It&rsquo;s as slow
as yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Ruth did so, and, having had some experience
in cases of illness, she realized that Fenn&rsquo;s fever
had gone down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You do seem better,&rdquo; she acknowledged.
&ldquo;However, I think it would be a good thing for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
the doctor to see you. I don&rsquo;t want you to run any
chances.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; agreed Fenn.</p>

<p>The physician came again and said that, much
to his surprise, Fenn&rsquo;s illness was not as alarming
as had at first appeared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t I go out?&rdquo; asked the lad, not telling
what for.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hum&mdash;ah&mdash;er&mdash;um&mdash;well, it&rsquo;s a little
risky, but then&mdash;well, I guess you can,&rdquo; and, after
much humming and hawing the medical man gave
his consent and left, shaking his head over the
perverseness of those who were always in a hurry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now send up my clothes, please,&rdquo; begged
Fenn, when the doctor was safely away. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ll
solve the mystery of that cave in jig style.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hadn&rsquo;t we better wait for the other boys?&rdquo;
suggested Ruth. &ldquo;Besides it&rsquo;s nearly dinner time,
and you ought to eat something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good idea,&rdquo; declared Fenn, but, whether it
was the one about eating, or waiting for the boys he
did not say.</p>

<p>Frank, Bart and Ned were rather late getting
back from the motor boat ride, but they had such a
good time that no one blamed them. Mr. Hayward
also returned, and it was quite a merry party<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
that gathered about the table. That is all except
Mr. Hayward. He seemed to be rather worried
over something, and, at times, was rather distracted,
his thoughts evidently being elsewhere.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s worrying you, daddy?&rdquo; asked Ruth,
after a while.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing, my dear. Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not eating at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not very hungry. But come, we must go
with Fenn and see if we can&rsquo;t help him locate that
cave. I don&rsquo;t imagine we shall find anything of
any account. Most likely the men were engaged
in working an abandoned mine from which the prehistoric
inhabitants took everything of value.
Perhaps the men were those Chinese smugglers.
I have telephoned word to the Government authorities
about them, and some detectives may arrive
any minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Those men were not smugglers,&rdquo; declared
Fenn. &ldquo;They were taking something valuable
from that mine, and they were so secretive about
it that I&rsquo;m sure they had no right to the stuff.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ll soon see,&rdquo; declared Mr. Hayward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where are we going to begin?&rdquo; asked Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go up to that hole, where we found
Fenn&rsquo;s hat, and work down,&rdquo; suggested Ned.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s no good,&rdquo; declared the lad who had
made the queer passage. &ldquo;That chute only
comes out on the ledge, where the main shaft begins.
If we could get to the ledge we&rsquo;d be all
right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think we can get there without crawling or
sliding down that dark, roped passage,&rdquo; said Mr.
Hayward. &ldquo;But I was going to suggest that we
take the motor boat and cruise along near where
we picked Fenn up. If we found the opening in
the cliff, from where he jumped, it would be easier.
It is rather difficult to get to the ledge.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think that&rsquo;s the best idea,&rdquo; remarked Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;May I go with you, daddy?&rdquo; asked Ruth, a
bright flush of excitement coming into her cheeks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maybe I can find the&mdash;&rdquo; She stopped suddenly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid not. There might be danger,&rdquo;
said her father, not noticing her last remark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Fenn quickly. &ldquo;Those
men that I saw, didn&rsquo;t have any weapons, but they
might be ugly customers, just the same.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think you had better remain at home, my
dear,&rdquo; decided the girl&rsquo;s father, and, somewhat
against her will, she consented, after a whispered
conference with Fenn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
The others were soon in the motor launch, and
were cruising along the lake shore, as near as possible
to where Fenn had leaped into the water.
Narrowly they scanned the face of the cliff, for a
sight of the opening from which Fenn had
jumped. They went up and down for half a mile,
in either direction, but there was no sign of it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure you jumped out of a hole,
Stumpy?&rdquo; asked Bart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure. I remember catching just a glimpse of
that point of land before I went under water.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then the opening into the cave ought to be
somewhere near here,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Hayward,
bringing the boat to a stop.</p>

<p>Once more they scanned the cliff, going as close
to shore as they could. There appeared to be no
break in the surface of the palisade.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess we&rsquo;ll have to try the ledge,&rdquo; announced
Mr. Hayward. &ldquo;We can go down that
tree-trunk ladder, but it&rsquo;s more risky than this
way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was about to head the craft for a landing
place, in order to begin the tramp through the
woods, to a point whence the ledge could be
reached, when the attention of all in the motorboat
was attracted by something happening on
shore. From the bushes dashed a Chinaman, his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
pig-tail streaming in the wind. Behind him came
a man, with a revolver in his hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stop! You almond-eyed scare-crow!&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not going to hurt you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But the Chinaman only ran the faster. Suddenly
the man raised his revolver and fired in the
air. The Celestial stopped as though he had been
shot.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I thought that would fetch you!&rdquo; shouted
the man, and, a moment later, he had the handcuffs
on the representative of the Flowery Kingdom.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s one of the smugglers!&rdquo; cried Fenn.
&ldquo;The police must be after them!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the trouble?&rdquo; asked Mr. Hayward,
of the white man, as the boat neared shore.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Chinese smugglers,&rdquo; was the short answer.
&ldquo;We got the whole crowd a while ago, just as they
were landing a boat load in a secluded cove. But
are you Mr. Hayward?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was told to look out for you. I understand
you gave the information that led to the capture.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did, but these boys here told me of it.
They&rsquo;re to get whatever reward is coming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s a reward all right. This fellow
got away when we were bagging the rest. I had
a hard chase after him, and I wanted to catch him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
as he&rsquo;s one of the ring-leaders. But what are
you doing here; on the lookout for some more of
the Chinks?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, we&rsquo;re searching for a queer cave where
Fenn, one of these boys here, was kept a prisoner.
There have been some strange goings on in these
parts, and I&rsquo;d like to get at the bottom of them.
I thought maybe the smugglers had a hand in it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the mention of the cave, concerning which
Mr. Hayward gave the government officer a few
details, as Fenn had related them to him, the
Chinese captive seemed suddenly interested. When
Mr. Hayward told how they had so far, conducted
a baffling search, for the entrance, the Celestial
exclaimed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me show you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What does he mean?&rdquo; asked Mr. Hayward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blessed if I know,&rdquo; answered the officer.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that, John?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me show hole in glound. Me know. Clum
that way,&rdquo; and he pointed a short distance up the
lake.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose he knows where the entrance
is?&rdquo; asked Mr. Hayward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shouldn&rsquo;t wonder,&rdquo; replied the detective.
&ldquo;Those Chinks know more than they&rsquo;ll tell. Probably
he knows the game is up, and he may think,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
if he plays into our hands, he&rsquo;ll get off easier.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s lite!&rdquo; exclaimed the Chinese with a
grin. &ldquo;Me turn state&rsquo;s evidence. Me know.
Me show you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess he&rsquo;s an old hand at the game,&rdquo; commented
the officer. &ldquo;Probably it wouldn&rsquo;t be a
bad plan to follow his advice. Wait, I&rsquo;ll summon
a couple of my men, and we&rsquo;ll go along. No
telling what we&rsquo;ll run up against.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He blew a shrill signal on a whistle he carried
and soon two men emerged from the woods on
the run. They did not appear surprised to see
their chief with the prisoner, and at a word from
him they got into the motor boat, the handcuffed
Celestial meekly following.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, John, which way,&rdquo; asked the detective,
who introduced himself as Mr. Harkness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Up by bluushes,&rdquo; replied the Chinese, pointing
to a clump which grew on the cliff. &ldquo;Hole
behind bluushes, so no can see. Smart trick. Me
know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I believe he does,&rdquo; commented Mr. Harkness.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll unhandcuff him, and he can show us,&rdquo; and
he removed the irons from the almond-eyed chap.</p>

<p>The motor boat was put over to where the Chinaman
indicated. It came to a stop at the foot of a
sheer cliff, right under the clump of bushes, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
grew about thirty feet up from the surface of the
water.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How in the world are we going to get up there
without a ladder?&rdquo; asked Fenn. &ldquo;We should
have brought one along.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here ladder!&rdquo; suddenly exclaimed the Celestial,
who, at a question from one of the officers
gave his name as Lem Sing. &ldquo;Me get ladder.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Lem Sing took hold of a stone that jutted out
from the face of the cliff. He pulled on it, and
it came out in his hand. To it was attached a
strong cord, extending up somewhere inside the
cliff, Lem Sing gave a vigorous yank, and something
surprising happened.</p>

<p>The clump of bushes vanished, and, in their
place, was a round hole.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where I jumped from!&rdquo; exclaimed
Fenn.</p>

<p>But this was not all. Down the cliff, out of the
hole in the face of it, came tumbling a strong
rope ladder, being fastened somewhere inside the
hole.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That how up get!&rdquo; exclaimed Lem Sing, with
a grin. &ldquo;Now can up-go!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sure we can &lsquo;up-go&rsquo;!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Harkness.
&ldquo;Come on, boys,&rdquo; and he began to ascend
the ladder, which swayed rather dangerously.</p>

<h3>THE DISCOVERY&mdash;CONCLUSION</h3>


<p>The others followed, one at a time, leaving one
of the detectives in charge of Lem Sing.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, Fenn, lead the way,&rdquo; called Mr. Hayward.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess they&rsquo;ve all gone,&rdquo; said Fenn. &ldquo;There
don&rsquo;t seem to be any of the miners here, now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Hardly had he spoken when, turning a corner
in the shaft, the party came upon a curious scene.
In a big chamber, the same one which Fenn had
viewed from the crack in the door of his small
prison, there were half a score of men, working
by the light of torches, digging stuff from the
walls of the cave, and carrying it out in small
boxes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Here they are!&rdquo; shouted Fenn. &ldquo;This is
the place, and they&rsquo;re at work!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;To the shaft!&rdquo; shouted some one. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re
after us!&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a hurrying and scurrying to escape,
and, before the detectives or Mr. Hayward could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
make any move to capture the men, they had all
disappeared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come on!&rdquo; cried Mr. Harkness. &ldquo;Show us
the way to the shaft where the ladder is, Fenn!
Maybe we can nab some of &rsquo;em.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t worth while,&rdquo; declared Mr. Hayward.
&ldquo;These men were evidently afraid of being
caught, but, from what I can see, they were not
doing anything unlawful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; admitted Mr. Harkness. &ldquo;We caught
the last of them when we got Lem Sing. But
what were these men digging?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take a look,&rdquo; answered Robert Hayward.</p>

<p>Suddenly he gave a cry, as he took some of the
soft earth in his fingers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Say, this is almost as good as a silver mine!&rdquo;
exclaimed Mr. Hayward. &ldquo;This stuff is in great
demand! It&rsquo;s used by chemists, and they can&rsquo;t
get enough of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lucky for the man who owns this land,&rdquo; commented
Mr. Harkness. &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t see that it
concerns us. Guess I&rsquo;d better be going.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, man, this is my land!&rdquo; suddenly exclaimed
Mr. Hayward. &ldquo;I own a big tract in
here, but I believed it was worthless, and I was
about to sell it very cheap. Now&mdash;well, say, you
couldn&rsquo;t buy it! My fortune is made again!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
&ldquo;Boys,&rdquo; he went on, a little more soberly, &ldquo;you
don&rsquo;t know it, but I&rsquo;ve been in quite a hole lately.
The house where I live was about to be sold for a
mortgage. But my daughter never knew. She&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, she did,&rdquo; interrupted Fenn. &ldquo;She knew
all about it, and she was trying to help you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She did? You don&rsquo;t mean it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then Fenn explained; telling of Ruth&rsquo;s strange
remarks while in a delirium at his house, her unexpected
discovery of the cave, the man&rsquo;s threat,
her long silence under fear of it, and her desire
to aid her father to recover his wealth.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, this gets me!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Hayward.
&ldquo;Ruth is a girl that&rsquo;s hard to beat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They went to the foot of the shaft, where Fenn
had come down, but there were no men to be
seen.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let them go,&rdquo; suggested Mr. Hayward.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got all I want, and I must hurry and tell
my daughter the news, bless her heart!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was all Fenn&rsquo;s good luck,&rdquo; declared Ruth,
when the story had been told. &ldquo;You ought to
reward him, daddy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Reward him! Well, I guess I will. And
the other boys, too. Nothing is too good for
them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Chinese smugglers were punished for their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
attempt to break the United States immigration
laws, and the Celestials they tried to land were
sent back to Canada.</p>

<p>Lem Sing had planned the trick so that by pulling
on the rope the bushes dropped back out of
sight, and the ladder came down. The miners
used this device to send away the valuable clay,
and it was by this queer hole that the men on
the cliff so mysteriously appeared and disappeared
when the boys were watching them from the deck
of the <i>Modoc</i>.</p>

<p>The two Chinamen and the white man, whom
Fenn had followed, were the advance party, looking
to see if the coast was clear for a landing
which had once been unintentionally frustrated by
the boys, and, the visit of the one Chinese to the
camp was only to discover if the lads were detectives,
which Lem at first feared. While Fenn
was following the men, one had slipped behind
him and gone to the camp, to see if it was deserted.
It was this fellow who had dropped the
button which gave Frank, Ned and Bart their
clue.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But what I can&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; said Fenn, &ldquo;is
why that man Dirkfell should chase us the night
of the fire, and pursue us in the steam yacht. Do
you know him, Mr. Hayward?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
&ldquo;Dirkfell!&rdquo; exclaimed the gentleman. &ldquo;I
should say I did, to my sorrow. It was through
business dealings with him that I lost all my
wealth. He held the mortgage on this house, and
was about to buy that land, under which the cave
is located. He has long borne a grudge against
me&mdash;a grudge for which there is no excuse, for
I never injured him. When he heard of my loss
in the elevator fire I presume he could not help
saying how glad he was. Then, probably, when
he saw you looking at him so sharply, Fenn, he imagined
you must be some agent of mine. He was
evidently in fear of being found out in his secret
mining operations under my land, and that was
why he made such an effort to catch you, even
following the <i>Modoc</i>. I understand now, why he
was so anxious to get possession of this land that
I considered worthless. But I beat him at his own
game, thanks to you and your chums.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And your daughter did her part,&rdquo; said Fenn,
&ldquo;for she saw the cave first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course she did, God bless her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand how the Chinese smugglers
and the miners both used the cave and the
secret entrances,&rdquo; said Frank.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t until I had a talk with the detectives,&rdquo;
said Mr. Hayward. &ldquo;The Chinese used the cave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
a long time before Dirkfell was aware of what
valuable stuff was in it. He and his gang worked
in harmony with the Celestials.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are they going to try to catch him?&rdquo; asked
Fenn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, it&rsquo;s not worth while, since they have
broken up the smuggling gang. I guess Dirkfell
will not show himself in these parts soon again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Nor did he, or any of his gang. The boys
spent a week with Mr. Hayward. Then they
started back to Duluth, to join Captain Wiggs.</p>

<p>They found the <i>Modoc</i> ready to sail, and they
were warmly welcomed by the commander.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve certainly had some strenuous happenings
this trip,&rdquo; observed Frank. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
think we&rsquo;ll have such lively times again.&rdquo; But
he was mistaken, they did have plenty of adventures,
and what some of them were I shall relate
in another book, to be called &ldquo;Bart Keene&rsquo;s Hunting
Days.&rdquo;</p>

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
